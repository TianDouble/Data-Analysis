You work with smart people, you work on exciting projects, you are pushed to your limits...which can be rewarding when you accomplish great things.  The diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring.  I've often called Amazon my ""Sexy Mistress...she's emotionally abusive, but she's so sexy that I go back for more punishment.""","The management process is abusive, and I'm currently a manager.  I've seen too much ""behind the wall"" and hate how our individual performers can be treated.  You are forced to ride people and stack rank employees...I've been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking.","Don't pretend that the recent NY Times article was all about ""isolated incidents"".  The culture IS abusive and it WILL backfire once stock value starts to drop.  I'm an 8 year veteran and I no longer recommend former peers to interview with Amazon."
4,"Feb 23, 2018","""An Amazing Place to Work""",Current Employee - Software Development Manager,"Phoenix, AZ",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,I have been working at Amazon full-time for less than a year,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.",
5,"Dec 17, 2013","""Can be amazing for some people, horrible for others""",Current Employee - Software Development Manager,"Seattle, WA",4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,I have been working at Amazon full-time for more than 3 years,"Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too.  There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams.  The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.  You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned.  There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.","Stack ranking is a horrible practice since it's rife with favoritism.  It's also not Amazonian in that it's not data based (arbitrarily designating a certain percentage of employees that must be put on performance management isn't a data driven criterion) and it's not frugal (effectively forcing an individual out of the company in one division who would make the grade in another is either retaining someone who doesn't meet the bar or a waste of talent). The goal is to force managers to actually make the hard decisions about how their team members compare with each other (not everyone can be exceptional), but it has more defects than virtues.  Replace it with a common comparison of each person against the bar for their position, based on data.  The percentages that are assigned to each performance category will turn out how they turn out, but there will be an evaluation mechanism that's fair and frugal."

The culture is quick and hard charging.  You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.  This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon.  The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism.  Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.","Bezos you bought the Washington Post and hired Jay Carney to be your PR head.  There is nothing I can write here that you would deign listen to, because you are a hack.  You must be mad that Expedia beat you to the punch and hired Chelsea Clinton to serve on their board of directors.

For those grasping Weasels that have squirmed and back stabbed your way to success, you know who you are.  You won't care what is written here because ""You got yours, Eff them.""

For those truly diligent and hard working employees that don't want to believe the story from NY times that called Amazon a ""Snake Pit"" because you don't want to think you actually are involved in such a dystopian landscape of anti-business ethics: ""Always yell with the crowd.  It is the only means to be safe."""

I started in Finance and although I was good at it, I did not enjoy it as much as I believed I should. I then pursued Program Management and later Product Management, where I found my passion. The great thing about Amazon is that internal transfers are not only expected, but encouraged. I personally move about every 3 years, but the duration one stays in a role greatly varies across the company. It's all about continuing to learn, feeling there is meaning in what you are doing, and finding things you are passionate about.  Your time at Amazon will be what you make of it.  I enjoy working with extremely intelligent people on a daily basis and the ability to take full ownership of my work. I should mention that I am a mother of two children and have great work-life balance.","The Day 1 culture at Amazon means many things, but one of them is solving new industry problems. If you are not comfortable with ambiguity and solving  problems that have never been encountered before (to your knowledge), you may not enjoy working at Amazon.  Depending on your role, I have heard that work-life balance can be more challenging for those starting early in their careers and looking to move up the ladder quickly. However, if you set expectations with your manager with open conversations about your desired flexibility, you will likely find an arrangement that works for you. Work-life balance is something you create for yourself as a priority, it is not automatically handed to you.","I've been fortunate to always have a great manager at Amazon, but I've seen others that do not. Your relationship with your manager will be a major factor in your enjoyment at work. IE: micro-managing vs empowerment, etc. For this reason, I'd encourage management to be open to feedback and reflect on your management style. Sometimes what you mistake for a weakness in your team's ability to deliver results could actually reflect a weakness in your management style. If you see high turnover in your team, perhaps take some time to reflect on your own actions rather than assuming they were 'not a good fit for the role.'"

The hiring bar is extremely high, so everyone is extremely talented.  Amazon VP's are some of the smartest people you will ever meet.  The whole company moves so quickly that every day you are working on a new major initiative.  The leadership principles are literally used everyday - people quote them in meetings, and the company only focuses on customers, never on competitors.  It's quite remarkable.  If you get an offer to work at Amazon, take it.","I stayed for over 6 years which put me above 98% of other Amazonians (there's a tool called ""oldfart"" that compares your tenure to other employees).  Most people only last 2-3 years for several reasons.  First, the pace is relentless which at first is exhilarating but becomes downright fatiguing.  Second, Amazon doesn't really care about you as a person - only as a productive cog in the machine.  Third, the RSU award program is ok, but total comp is really only great if the stock is climbing 30% a year.  Finally, everyone wants to hire an ex-Amazonian right now.   When you combine these, Amazon becomes an amazing training ground, but not a great place to stay long-term.","Amazon comp is decent, but many other top tier companies can match it with better benefits. PTO is weak and employee perks like discounts are non-existent.  The 401(k) is limited and many other companies offer better stock vesting plans.

I have a license in my profession that requires 7 years of advanced schooling before sitting for that license. In contrast, MBAs are hired at a higher level than me. The promotional process has looked for a ""unicorn,"" which is a fantastic beast that does not exist. It was great to learn here, but there is no upwards trajectory. This has a disproportionate impact on women and people of color, who are consistently hired with the same credentials as people in a traditionally higher level role than the rest of us.","Hire for the right level. Do not hire high functioning, licensed professionals for work that does not require that license, and then use the fact that the job description does not technically require said license as a reason for slower promotions. Do a deep dive on the numbers and how this breaks down by underrepresented minorities. Consider tailoring base compensation to the amount of time and education represented in those numbers. Presumably licensed professionals in non-license required jobs nevertheless have the same bills as other people with those licenses (e.g., student loans.)

I really like this company and want to help it succeed, but I also need to be mindful of my own career trajectory and right now this company = status quo for the foreseeable future."

I moved my entire family more than once to work on projects. There was always a big rush to get me in position. Only when I got there I find that the project has no proper production discipline, blind management, and a firm belief that if you just put a plan to paper it will happen. We went through an exhaustive effort to create a better publishing structure with milestones and gates, only to have it ignored 2 months after we started. After a few years here I felt drained of energy. The organization is so complex, getting anything approved or let alone finding who is in charge of a certain project is a tremendous task. And then when it all went south they hit the LAYOFF button. Laid off 200+ people...everyone except the management who actual made the awful decisions. We let go of some amazing talent that had long advocated against the decisions management was making.  To add insult to injury I had to try and go around a beg for another job in the company - re-interviewing just like a new employee. Only thing is the terrible reputation of the games division inside the company is like the kiss of death with other teams.","Re-think how you approach the ""Hire and develop the best"" leadership principle.
Take a deep dive into how other game devs and their use of Associate Producers and EPs to keep a dev team on task. 
Don't just hire older game devs because of what they did in the past. Look for new talent dying to prove themselves. 
Actually trust the market research you are collecting instead of your own gut. Doing the latter has gotten you nowhere.
Someone needs to put the big boy pants on and combine Amazon and Twitch orgs so that they are on the same page. Both are going to lose out on the gaming opportunity if they stay divided."

- Lots of opportunity for individuals of all levels to carve out areas of expertise and programs to own
- Fantastic mechanisms in place for vision setting, delivery, etc.
- Amazon is typically ""great"" at everything they offer to customers--developing their own tools/technology,  solving problems quickly, the quality of delivered products, etc. If you like working for the best, Amazon is it.
- People here are brilliant. You get a PhD level education quickly.
- If you're great at ownership and delivery, you can experience fantastic work flexibility and balance (see cons for flip side). I've worked here for years in multiple orgs and have never downloaded email on my phone or worked a weekend.","- Ownership is used as an excuse to not provide direction or support
- Managers are rarely allowed to truly manage - must also deliver as individuals
- Very difficult to be promoted
- Leadership is overwhelmed by scale and out of touch with employees
- Few benefits
- Average compensation
- Frequent management changes and reorganizations mean that employee expectations and growth plans are often changed
- Easy to get lost in huge company. Hard to get visibility.
- HR protects the company, NOT the employees.
- Little to no accountability for managers who make decisions that negatively affect those that work for them
 - If you are NOT naturally inclined to ownership and have trouble quickly delivering expectations,  you will quickly be overwhelmed and will have no work life balance.",Develop clear training requirements for managers. Make promotions an expectation and benchmark for manager success. Hold managers accountable for negative decisions.  Commit to employee growth. Introduce compelling benefits for employees to stay beyond RSUs to reduce churn. Commit multiple HR business partners to organizations instead of just one. Hold managers accountable for delivering on employee growth plans.

Your coworkers are some of the smartest and most talented people in the industry; you will learn quite a bit from smart people","Senior management (particularly in Minneapolis) is awful. They will pit you against your coworkers. Prepare to be in a continual depressive state after your third month of working there.

Nobody cares about you or your personal growth there. You have to be the person in charge. Any ""trainings"" or ""conferences"" are done on your own dime and managers will see all personal growth as time you could have spent doing work for them.

Work life balance is poor if your manager decides they don't like you; it's always arbitrary. Amazon pretends to be a ""data driven"" company, but it's all political and managers *will* manipulate data however they see fit. I know some people whose managers like them that do little to no work and have found the gravy train. Good luck if that's you!

They are having attrition problems because they are driving many people out. Presumably because Amazon is cutting a significant part of its workforce! Sooner or later that will hit you.",Mandatory attrition rates to continually cut engineers while managers continue to get paid is dehumanizing.

It all makes things harder for employees in the warehouse and the flex driver employees.

They also put a lot of pressure on employees. Getting one person to try to keep up with a two person job is not a smart idea. It just slows everything down and stresses the employees.

Also the ambassadors are lazy and the training is terrible. There's no feedback for when you are doing something incorrectly. The management and ambassadors just don't pay attention to employees and it's hurting the warehouse.","Listen to the suggestions of the employees that have to actually do the work. 
Pay attention to your employees and notice who actually works hard and who doesn't. 
Giving feedback for mistakes or for doing well would help out a lot for the growth of the employees. It'll also show management pays attention and cares.
Train train train! Get a better training system."

- Free hot coco and coffee.
- First week(s) are painfully sore, but new  employees on their 3rd and 4th day have the opportunity to leave at any time with VTO (voluntary time off), and it's helpful to just take some ibuprofen when you're sore.
-  I'm 19 and 160 , i'm not conditioned, but i was one of the fastest people in the warehouse on my third day,  to me stowing can be pretty easy.
- To some the minimal standards for units put away per hour when stowing can be un-achievable. Thankfully the first 4 weeks you work at amazon they give you a ""learning curve"" so you only have to manage 70% of what they ask the first week for instance.
- Very good benefits, highest coverage for one person i think is 39$ a month, lowest being 15$ a month.
- No education needed.
- Management promotions i have seen within 6 months for T1 employees.
- Holiday pay is time and a half plus 8 hours. so if you work the 10 hour shift on a holiday that's 345$ instead of the usual 150$.
- TONS of opportunities for overtime, which is 22.50$ an hour.
- You start with 10 hours of PTO (paid time off) and 10  hours of UPT (unpaid time off). 
- 40 hours of vacation accrues over a year, and rolls over the next.
- After one year you get 80 hours of vacation a year.","- Insane amount of speed walking from stations to lockers to make sure you clock in/out on time and not use any UPT (unpaid time off).
- UPT is taken out by the hour, so if your 6 minutes late to work, they take 1 hour of UPT.
- only lockers are in the front.
- working and walking can be unbearable if you aren't conditioned, i'm surprised i see people working here over 40.  
- You need to eat pretty fast. 
- when stowing sometimes you only get large boxes and not enough pods come by to put them in. This decreases your ""takt time"" and units you put away. 
- it can get pretty hot on some floors, i'd always recommend wearing shorts, and carrying a water bottle to your station.
- Mandatory overtime. 
- I wear my fitbit to Amazon, according to the fitbit, i usually walk 4-6 miles per 10 hour shift at Amazon, which is roughly 13k-17k steps.
- The statistics your managers base you on can be pretty brutal. If you need to go the bathroom  before a break happens, your takt time will be almost un-fixable.","Increase breaks or lunch by 5 minutes, if you get stationed in the back of the building you have to run/walk to get to the lockers in time to clock out and to have enough time to eat."

Let me break it down.

Say you're scheduled to work 4, 4 hour shifts a week most times they flex down unless it peak season.  So in essence, you're working maybe 12 or 13 hours of them time you're scheduled to work.  You only get paid for that time that you work so you have to pick up extra hours to earn close to what you're supposed to be earning a week.   Well, although it may seem great to only work 3 hours when you're working, when you think about it you have to plan to work 4 'just in case' so you have to dedicate (in your mind at least 4) per shift of your time.  

$15 x 12 = $180  That $180/16 hours that you're scheduled to work and can't do anything else during that time is $11.25/ hour.  Do the math, it's not what it seems.",

Only two managers ever attempted to train me to do things beyond what I was already doing because they could tell I have bigger potential. Then circling back to the ambassador competition some were hesitant to fully teach what they know because that's seems like more competition for them.","Stop engaging in petty gossip.

Do not encourage the idea that ambassadorship is the road to promotions knowing good and well opportunities are far and few between and letting these people rip each other apart to be the favorite.

When choosing promotions, chose the hardest working, most knowledgable, and consistent worker, not the one that was pretty high up on the list, but they brought you lunch, came around a lot, and was chummy. Not only that, you told that one you hand-picked about the opening to apply, and stayed hush with the other top employees. That was ugly. I'd be surprised if your clear-cut best associate is still working there after that stunt.

Give leniency to your top employees.

Do not overextend ambassadors, you know they are eager to please and it was sick to watch you overwork and underappreciate those people. A different-color vest can only keep an employee happy so long.

Do not unnecesarily micromanage good employees.

The ""local"" HR there is slow and useless. I believe this is a 100% remote job, and if it's not, let that be a caution of how absentee they are. Let them have office space where people can be in contact with their concerns more immediately.

-You have a quota that you must meet. If you fail to meet the ""numbers"", you can be written up.
-Long days on a cement floor, and sometimes really heavy lifting with no assistance.
-People can be a little abrasive to work with and some employees learned English as a second language. Difficult to communicate over loud warehouse environment.","Managers and Supervisors need to be
Amazon Warehouse boasts an open door policy. This allows for employees to talk to both supervisors, managers, HR, etc.. without fear. This is a sound business practice, however, how can the individuals communicate with their chain of command if they have no idea who those individuals are.

Relax on the rating system
Many of the supervisors stress employees to reach a certain quota. If this quota is not reached, they will be reprimanded, retrained and eventually let off. This is understandable for a company to seek elevated productivity, however, many employees feel they are being abused. Quota over safety and health of the employees is the belief of much of the warehouse.  

Lack of trainers
Many employees have voiced their concern over training in collateral duties in each respective area of the warehouse. It is difficult to understand why certain duties are not being fulfilled, however, no employees are being trained to complete those duties. Those that perform highly in their respective field are not rewarded with more job training, but instead granted more work. 

Work Hard, Have Fun, Make History
Morale is quite low in the warehouse. (Just an observation).  With ""Have Fun"" as a motto at the warehouse, one would assume you would actually be having fun. Many say ""Have Fun"" sarcastically before returning to their shift."

Amazon (AWS in my case) teaches you (you mostly teach yourself) how to approach almost any business/technical situation using their Leadership Principles (LPs). The Amazonian way is highly structured in many regards, in that the LPs are something you must embrace and embody if you want to succeed here. On the other hand, Amazon has structured their organization and their culture a lot like a startup. The basis for this is the Two Pizza Team (TPT) construct. TPTs aren't successful merely because the small team size. The effectiveness of the TPT is more about the autonomy these teams are given to solve virtually any problem they encounter, so long as it ties back to the customer. This leads me to an important point: Of all the LPs at Amazon, Customer Obsession is the one that rules them all. Everything we do connects back to solving problems for our customers. In fact we ""work backwards"" from the customer on just about everything we do. It is truly obsessive. 

Our motto is: Work Hard. Have Fun. Make History.  And this is exactly what we are doing.","What I am listing here are not ""cons"" per se for me. I just know that many folks might see them this way. 

Amazon is not for everyone. If you are looking for lavish perks, you won't find them here. One of our LPs is Frugality. Like most everything we do, this ties back to the customer. If we are spending tons of cash on employee perks, we are reducing our ability to offer the best prices on our goods and services. I personally don't see this as a ""con,"" but I know that many folks might, so I placed it here. 

If I had to describe my experience here thus far using only one word, that word would be ""athletic."" You are constantly challenged here, and while most folks think they want to be constantly challenged, far fewer actually do in reality. This is my experience. So before coming to work here, spend some time with any Amazonians you know. Ask them what it's like. and listen carefully.","Athletes (see my comment above) need top quality fuel. The cafeterias here are serving up low quality, nutrient poor foods like hamburgers, pizza, and french fries. Please consider bringing in some new vendors that can offer fresh, organic foods that are delicious and healthy. A good example is Sweet Greens here in NY. As we employees pay for these meals, and there are no subsidies, there is little or no cost for Amazon to do this. Other ideas: A daily sushi station. Organic juice and smoothy station. Organic salad bar (fresh, locally sourced)."

I was supposed to receive the orientation link to do online. After calling 3 separate days, I still did not get the Orientation Email - 2 days before start date and still have not received it.

They hire everyone on as Seasonal. I had no idea because I applied for Part Time. No where on my paperwork did it say Seasonal. I found this out at my appointment. Amazon cuts costs this way because they don't have to pay tuition reimbursement or health benefits. 

They literally hire anyone that can pass a drug test and criminal background. This means you can work with the laziest or unprofessional employees and have to pick up their slack.

Very impersonable. Honestly, this experience has made me severely rethink purchasing through them online knowing what the person goes through who's putting my box together.

Start dosing on ibuprofen beforehand as a countermeasure for the Amazonian experience that commences shortly thereafter.,"I got my first look inside an Amazon Fulfillment Center as a Fulfillment Associate. My perspective on Amazon has changed as a result. This isn't some Amazon bashing missive, but more of a bare bones raw analysis of a middle-aged man's experience inside Jeff's castle. 

It's a grueling job and isn't for the meek or timid. Your body will hurt after 9 hours of manual labor with 2- 1/2 hour breaks. I never complained about the work; I knew going into the position almost every muscle fiber in my body would plead for mercy and relief. If you've ever watched the Spartan events on TV or YouTube, be prepared to face similar challenges at Amazon's FC's if you're not used to physical labor. I'm a very fit individual; my tolerance may be higher than yours. Most Fulfillment Associates throw in the towel at the 4 month mark per my Area Manager; many don't make it that far (either due to exhaustion or they are fired for performance). They have their own in-house clinic to keep aches, pains, moans, and groans ""in-house."" In addition, it's no surprise during training, the Learning Ambassadors were quick to point out the PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) vending machine always freshly stocked with OTC painkillers, antacids, eye drops, etc. to combat the sheer bruteness of the $15 hr. job. By the way, you need to scan your badge for those ibuprofen; your dosing is monitored. 

Nonetheless, I put the pain aside in an attempt to climb the promotion ladder and kept up the pace. You will be evaluated for Time On Task (or TOT for short) and quality & quantity of your scans. Mr. Bezos expects 9 full hours of work for every calorie consumed by a Fulfillment Associate. I never once had a performance issue although I was coached for a safety issue. 

Eventually, my ""fight or flight"" response set in. My body was being used as a vessel; there is a consequence for taking this position. It's not all smiles on the inside of an Amazon FC, but cries of pain concealed by OTC painkillers and a false sense of security. There is this ""robotic culture"" within an Amazon FC that simply replaces your devoid flesh like a Amazon drone picking up an empty plastic water bottle left in the grass. As soon as the Amazon drone lifts off and discards your body, you're replaced with a fresh set of legs until that water source runs dry. It's a vicious cycle repeated week after week. It's what makes Amazon so successful. 

I have no ill-will towards my former employer. I still shop on Amazon, but my check-out experience is a little more painful for internal reasons",The robot culture at Amazon needs to be reintroduced to a human strain.

If you select part-time they will hire you and won't inform you that you're full-time until the first day. They phrase it as ""Reduced Time"" because it's 36 hours,  (3-days, 12 hour shifts) instead of 40 (5-days, 8 hour shifts). But that doesn't  matter because you stated that you only wanted to work 24 hours maximum per week. Then they try to pressure you into staying. They don't care that you purposely wanted to be part-time because you're in school full-time, already have another full-time job, kids and a family. All they care about is themselves and keeping employment as a revolving door. You get lured in with wage differential shifts at rates of $17-18 overnights and weekends but what they don't tell you is that the intensity of the labor and the rate at which you're expected to perform said labor isn't worth it. Truly everyone in stowing should be making at least $25/hour its the toughest job in the warehouse. Also, when you're hired, they don't tell you which jobs are available and assess your skill level or experience, they just assign you to a post and you take it or quit. They say you can move around and try other positions later but there's a 30 day waiting period and you have to have a certain amount of UPT (unpaid time) in the bank to show that you're responsible. You can't have your phone with you on the warehouse floor for ""safety"" reasons. If you challenge the validity of that statement they say ""It's also to protect proprietary information and the company."" Mind you everything we perform and the machines and systems we use has been debuted on prime time  news outlets and on YouTube by Amazon for publicity. So it's not to protect proprietary stuff. It's so if conflict arises or you want to document working conditions you can't and then its just your work against theirs. They claim we also can't have phones on the warehouse floor because they fulfill cellphone orders. I seriously doubt that security wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a new phone and a newly stolen phone. First of all, one can't be activated and the other already has service, photos, phone numbers, etc in it. Bathrooms and water fountains are super far from work stations. You have less than 10 minutes to get to the bathroom and use it and return to your work station or your metrics drop. The metric system for time is so unfair. The 1/2 mile, 10 minute foot commute to and from the time clock and through security metal detector checkpoint is apart of the actual break period. So your 30 minute break could essentially become a 15 minute break. If you get to the time clock and punch back in 1 minute too late you're assessed 1 whole hour of UPT (unpaid time). You only get 20 hours every quarter (once every 4 months). If you're working only 12 hour shifts that's not even 2 days off if you have a family emergency or illness. PTO is is worse. Amazon outsources their leave requests to a third party -The Reed Group. Requirements to qualify for unpaid leaves are sketchy. God forbid you have an HR issue. Site HR persons will tell you to go online to the HR portal and will flat out refuse to help you. The automated response you get from some person or bot online directs you back to site HR. It's a big circle and vicious cycle of passing the buck. The performance metrics for stowing are unreasonable and cause fatigue. You have to move 300 units per hour at a rate of 10 seconds between each item you place on a shelf in a pod. Most of the pods are stuffed and overflowing so there's nowhere to stick the items or it takes longer for you to maneuver other items around that are already in the pod to make room for your items. You also have to place empty bins aside so that takes away from your Tackt time (10 second max) which might move you up to 30 seconds. The compliance metrics are even more insane because if decanters make a mistake on their counts it reflects poorly on you as an overage or shortage, because they don't do QA compliance or tracking  in decant. The Working Well program and stretches performed during  stand up before your shift are a joke and don't work. AmCare is to placate employees to return to work injured instead of seeking real medical care.","The capitalist monster that is Amazon, which consumes employees and spits them out, cannot thrive if you don't conceded to their brainwashing, and bullying, harassment and micromanagement of lower lying employees.

DO NOT WALK""",Former Employee - Data Associate,"Boston, MA",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,I worked at Amazon full-time for more than a year,The ONLY pro are the benefits- benefits are unbeatable,"Many other reviews have summarized this place well so I will try to describe instances not listed on Glassdoor. TLDR; described by current employees as a ""social experiment"" ""mind games"" ""toxic"" ""carrot and stick approach"". This department is a “data warehouse” where you are expected to come in, sit down, shut up and hit your quota. They do not care about ANYTHING except SLAs. THIS IS NOT THE COLLABORATIVE, MODERN, PROGRESSIVE AMAZON YOU HAVE IN MIND; this is the Amazon they want to keep quiet. For over a year, I would wake up with extreme anxiety. There were mornings I would have panic attacks and start crying before 9 AM for no reason other than this job made me miserable beyond belief. This job DOES NOT translate well into other positions because there is so little required of you; there is little to no skill development nor career growth here. You are bound by a strict NDA, which further limits what you can disclose on your resume. In terms of growth, I had to BEG for stretch projects that I could work on to develop my skill set and to help me gain visibility within the organization. I was doing everything in my power to find a position internally/externally where I would actually be using my brain and contributing towards real progress. Luckily for me, my mentors at Amazon saw what a struggle it was to get promoted internally and encouraged me to look for positions outside of Amazon- even providing me references. BE AWARE that once you hit Level 3 you will hit a wall and you will be told that to level up any further it is in your hands. It will be up to you to ""create a role"" that ""fills a business need"" and then management ~MIGHT~ consider it if you are convincing enough.  Your extra efforts and strong skills don’t matter and will not be recognized unless YOU make a role for yourself.  Otherwise, if sitting at a computer pressing the same 5-10 keys sounds appealing to you then this is your place. Especially if you enjoy being micromanaged and having your every waking second time tracked. To add insult to injury, at managers DO NOT TRAIN OR WORK IN YOUR WORKFLOW; this means you can never go to your manager with a workflow specific question because THEY DON’T KNOW! Yet your manager will try to provide you with “tips” and “advice’ on how to “do better”- pretty hypocritical coming from someone who has NEVER worked in the workflow.  The most discouraging thing about this role is to see the rapid turnover throughout Senior Management and Operations; everyone above you transitions in and out of new projects, roles, and advances their career paths in a few months time, while the rest of the associate population withers away with no opportunity. You will also be expected to fill ""stretch roles""- roles meant to be temporary or that seem like an opportunity of redemption before being promoted; it is neither of those things. These ""stretch roles"" are meant to seem enticing and appetizing as if they are there for vindication. They are actually a trap to get you to do way more for way less.  Otherwise, permitted you are hitting production goals you WILL sit idly by doing “queue work” for the rest of your days here",

Training consisted of watching a series of videos (which were prefaced by comments 'try not to fall asleep') followed by written tests.  Those who didn't pass the written portions were given the same test to take minutes after given the answers. The hands on portion of training on the stand up fork lifts lasted all of 15 minutes,  followed by a mind numbing overview of identification of bar codes and the order picking process.   Formal training lasts all of a day and a half before you are put out on the floor to figure much of it out for yourself.  Good luck finding your way around a 1 million sq. ft warehouse dodging several different types of power equipment while the machine you are operating is slowed to 3 mph due to the fact that you are in 'training' mode for the first 30 days.  Many of the aisles have debris, mainly dog food from bags that were broken open and not properly swept up, and just run over.  There are some decent people working there, but know going in that most are not. Many are only there because they could pass a drug screen and they didn't have to interview to get hired.  Of the 20 people that were in my orientation, 4 were still employed after 3 days.  There are many upper management positions that are unfilled, and the management staff that are there are no doubt looking for openings at other locations.  This is a miserable job coupled with mandatory overtime (so much for the Amazon promise of work-life balance), lousy training programs and supervisors who are in way over their heads.","Work hard, have fun, make history."

You are able to work on high-profile projects even in an entry-level design position. If you are starting out in design, I would recommend it since you learn a lot very quickly. 

Because Amazon is so large, every team is almost like a different company, so it really depends on your manager and the product owners you work with to have a healthy working environment. For instance, I don't work more than 9-5 except in very special occasions.

I've found designers have it much easier than developers. Many times as a designer, you are able to shape a product in its early stages. 

The commitment to customer translates to caring quite a bit about ux research, though far more in the quantitative than qualitative.","It's very much a sink or swim environment, nobody will hold your hand and you really have to figure things out for yourself. Amazon has all the negatives of startup culture and corporate culture with few of positives. Things are disorganized and messy and everything is on a tight budget. 

It's very rare to find healthy developer/designer relationships. They exist, but are few and far between. Front-end developers just started being hired but most developers working front-end are trained as back-end and are learning as they go.

Product managers are truly the product designers at Amazon, and many will use designers to literally translate what they have in their mind. Again, your relationship with your product manager and dev team will make your break your experience here.","Invest more heavily in design in a real and meaningful way. For being a ""Big Four tech company"" our design culture is sorely lacking compared to the other three.

I've been on teams where I've had a great experience, with a project that had considerable buy-in. Other teams end up having many issues, with projects being abandoned or redundant.

The people at Amazon are smart, and very hard working. The work culture I would say isn't as awful as you would have expected a few years ago, and there's been a lot of effort to improve that area. The people are not the problem, it's the corporate structure and the priorities higher-up.","Abysmal HR structure. I had to communicate some urgent matters a few months before my start-date, but it took several emails to multiple people. Turnover rate is also high-- in between my internship and my full time return offer, I had changed between five different recruiters.

Disturbing lack of concern for ethics. AWS powers ICE technology. If you try to speak out, they will put you on a dev plan-- a polite way to threaten you into quiet. Rekognition is a facial recognition technology which they're trying to implement for the government, which could be used to police immigrants and citizens. Ring is a home-security technology that has been discovered to have partnered with 200 law enforcement agencies (with racial profiling issues). There have been ""business dinners"" between Amazon execs and government officials. There is no sense of accountability when developing technology used by the government, not even a basic standard of ethical guidelines. Employees that bring up these issues in various letters, protests, and articles have been met with complete silence. Their approach is simply to ignore.

Manager-dependent career trajectory. There are some good managers, and some... not so great. Politics are huge, as in most large corporate tech companies. Stocks are on an awful vesting schedule, rewarding you for staying as long as possible instead of incentivizing you to stay of your own accord. People leave Amazon very quickly and within my team there's been at least three people who have left or switched teams within this year.

You also get a good workout (but it's easy work), which is pretty much what I needed anyways (I have always had a sitting office job, and this was a nice change of pace). I enjoy sorting alot more than some people because it keeps me busy until each break, and before I know it, work is over. It beats always checking the time.

Safety is huge here, which I admire greatly. Bottom line is, so far the leaders seem quite empathetic, which is always nice.

- Low-cost health, dental, vision, and life insurance
- Long breaks in between workweeks; 3 on/4 off, or 4 on/3 off","- Incompetent lower- and middle-management
- Abysmal vacation & time-off structure
- Thuggish tactics employed to prevent union activity
- Training for some positions and activities is improper; associates will often only be made aware they were not trained properly when they have committed a violation and have already been terminated
- No advancement opportunity
- No sick time, only an unpaid hour system that doubles as an employee attendance behavior monitoring system","Lower- and middle-management - who interact directly with entry-level associates - are not experienced in the warehouse field; they are simply in possession of at least a 4-year college degree, and this is the only qualification. Amazon should institute a culture of hiring managers in charge of directly supervising the primary work staff that have industry experience.

Amazon has a very low rate of employee retention due to its lackluster working conditions. There is no logistically significant reason that associates in some positions cannot perform their function while seated. Many functions require only arm and shoulder movement, which would not be impeded by a seated position. Many associates sought employment with Amazon because they are elderly or otherwise health-impaired and were in need of low-cost health insurance... the company has taken great advantage of those in such situations.

Amazon does not lay-off according to business seasonality, however, they will do whatever they can to fire as many people as they can find an excuse to fire. Often, they will only enforce some safety or procedural standards when they are looking for people to violate such standards. Write-ups are frequent, but only for performance-based faults. Any ""violation"" - legitimately documented in some sort of body of policy or not - is grounds for termination. There is no form of employee representation in matters that may possibly lead to dismissal, and most any such violation leads to termination, followed by an appeal process with a sub-1% success rate.

This facility has dutifully dismissed employees for union activity. A notable case was covered by news outlets in early Spring 2019, though numerous other employees have been terminated for the same reason. It seems that every time someone mentions union organization, they commit a ""safety violation"" and are terminated.

Additionally, they are not very graceful when employees seek to leave the company. I left on my own accord in April 2019 after 6 months of employment. I spoke to my manager, who told me ""you can just stop coming it's fine."" Feeling as though that was unprofessional, I spoke with HR, who informed me that the only way to leave the company ""voluntarily"" is to accept a buyout at the end of peak season or after completion of a career advancement course offered by the company, and that the only way to leave the company otherwise is to run yourself out of Unpaid Time - an hour-based pseudo-system used to monitor employee behavior -  and accept ""involuntary separation of employment."" I complained after my leaving to the NYSDOL about this, and two weeks later I received a letter from Amazon that did not directly acknowledge my NYSDOL complaint, but frequently repeated ""voluntary separation,"" perhaps an example of the company backing down to their own questionable behaviors in an attempt to mitigate chances of a lawsuit."

Shift bonuses for working nights and/or weekends.
 
Training is extensive to cover many situations and expectations are made clear. Safety is emphasized! There are always risks in the warehouse industry, but Amazon has a very comprehensive and consistent safety training compared to other warehouses in the area.

There is a positive work culture where questions and concerns are encouraged, and teamwork is emphasized. Area Managers and assistant managers (“Process Assistants”) are available and work to make the job easier and more possible for the standard workers to accomplish. (It was actually my AM and PA’s that made me want to return to the job after a gap in my seasonal employment since I had built relationships with them and they made the work day better). HR is usually available for any concerns, and they plan fun monthly events if you want to participate and receive prizes (tee shirts, candy bars, raffles, etc).

If you are a full-time employee ‘blue badge’ (and not a seasonal ‘white badge’) you get options for time off, paid sick time, and vacation hours. Many ‘blue badge’ workers also utilize the tuition program for college students. If you are willing to stay long term (multiple years) and are a dedicated worker, there are opportunities for growth within the company. 

You are supplied with all the safety gear you need, even common OTC medications should you need them. The breakrooms and bathrooms are nice (at least, nicer than other places I’ve worked) which makes the job easier.","It is a physical job, the environment is noisy and can be dirty. There is a lot of walking, the shifts are long, you will sweat, and you will get exhausted easily if you are not careful to make sure you sleep and eat enough. Many people who were used to office or customer services settings had a hard time adjusting to the warehouse setting, but some people actually prefer the warehouse setting. Just know going in that is very much a warehouse job.

You could be monitored on a system to make sure you are on task (and not “time off task”), to make sure you are not making to many errors (“quality”), and also to make sure you are getting enough work done (”making rate”). This should not be a problem if you are working well and at the expected pace, but some employees had a hard time getting used to having their work being closely monitored.

Traffic and parking is a bit of a hassle, but if you allow yourself enough time to get parked and walk into the building you will be fine.

If you are a Seasonal “white badge”:
- attendance is stringent. You will be required to be on time and present for the whole shift every day you are scheduled, even on mandatory overtime days. There are a few days/hours (they use a point system to track attendance) but if you miss more than 3 full days or 6 half days or are excessively tardy, they will discontinue your contract. However, this is alike to the attendance policies of most surrounding warehouses.
- be aware that they can stop your employment at any time for any reason without providing an explanation. This was stated during hiring, but then during training, many of us were told that if we worked hard we would probably get “converted”, so this created some false hope and unrealistic expectations. They will let white badges go if they need to, no matter how good or hard you worked.","Con: Even though employees should be 'flexible' and open to new situations, one of the things I (and that many others I knew) liked the most about the job was the predictability. Keeping an open line of honest communication sets clear expectations. Not telling the standard workers what is happening/changing just frustrates most of us, because we aren't stupid and can usually figure it out anyways. Change is good, but having at least a little warning makes it easier to adjust and makes for more efficient workers. 

Pro: It was actually my AM and PA’s that made me want to return to the job after a gap in my seasonal employment (laid off after Peak, rehired in April) since I had built relationships with them and they made the work day better. The sense of community and teamwork at Amazon is better than any of my previous warehouse jobs and made the job more pleasant (much more bearable, as opposed to ""man, I really hate my job""). This makes a huge difference and will motivate employees to stay longer and become more efficient in their process."

People are more inclined to work it if they aren’t force to work it, understand employees would like major holidays off with family. The company isn’t going to go out of business if phone support isn’t available or consider it an open work day for those that want to work. Get rid of the shift bidding. Many of us have second jobs and the shift bids interferes with that. Promote from within first, consider letting employees do work explore to see if another area would be a good fit for them.

That's the main pro. However, the stock vesting timeline is very imbalanced, compared to similar companies.  Also, there's a base pay cap company-wide of like 160k, so if you get hired or promoted to higher-level positions that should pay more than that, you're just promised more future stock vesting on a very slow timeline.

Stock vesting schedule: Of the total number of shares promised to you in your job offer, you get 5% after your first year, 15% after 2nd, and then 20% every 6 months till you finish your 4th year.

Oh, one more thing - since there are so many orgs and teams, if you get sick of yours in particular, there are always openings in completely different parts of the company, which you can apply for.

bad for your back","I worked for amazon for only a few months. I enjoyed working there but when the weather is hot, it is VERY hot and humid in the warehouse. There is no AC, they have a few big fans but they always point them towards supervisors and ambassadors not the employees who are actually moving around and doing all the hard labor.. the ones who need the fan the most.. I felt sluggish and drained due to how hot it was in the warehouse. I felt like i could go crazy. Then supervisors come up to you and pick on you because your rate is low. they tell you to work faster. I was one of the fastest stowers, my rate was always up but it fell drastically during the summer..  they need to stop picking on employees and put AC in the warehouse. other than that, i enjoyed working here during the winter, there are opportunities and you can transfer to any location in any state."

It’s easy to learn how to scale your work here and gives you a level of perspective on an enormous corporation that you simply can’t understand until you experience it.","I have never been as stressed in my life as I have been during the nearly four years of my tenure here. I have never felt secure in my job in spite of my tenure. True reflections of your performance from management are hard to come by, and the politics are real. Know that if you join Amazon, you have to play politics and learn to be friends with people you would otherwise hate.  As others have mentioned, this company stack ranks employees and politics plays a heavy hand in ranking - you can be great at your job and get a horrible ranking because someone with  a little power doesn’t particularly like you.  The level of fear and stress I have about my job performance at Amazon is shocking, and I suspect a therapist would tell me that I have PTSD. 

You can regularly expect to be working the jobs of 2 people because open positions sit for so long without getting filled. I don’t recommend applying to my friends because my own experience has been so negative.

Expecting your employees to run full speed all the time is a fantastic way to lose great people and, when stocks begin to decline and antitrust regulation becomes real, it’s a great way to ensure that people won’t apply to your jobs. 

A dedication to work-life balance isn’t reflected in the actions of management. My SVP regularly says things like, “if you just stayed an hour or two later every single day, just think about all the things you could get done.” He either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that our partners, children, and friends won’t always be waiting for us and this isn’t a healthy request. Job listings tout Amazon as the kind of place where you can work from home if you need to, and you can take care of your kids if you need to. The reality in my department is that working from home is strongly discouraged and telecommuting gets snide remarks from our SVP. So here’s the rundown: longer hours at salary, no telecommute option, unclear and arbitrary job rankings have made for an ultimately negative employment experience."

Overall I have had a very positive experience at Amazon","First-To-Market: Amazon is successful because we launch fast, but this often means introducing tech debt and hacks. Tech debt reduction rarely gets prioritized, even if it has clear business value in launching features faster.

Tools?: we use a lot of internal tools, many of which don't have clear documentation. Error handling, measurement and root cause analysis are challenging as there is no standard across teams--this means you ssh into hosts a lot to diagnose issues

Business owners not technical: At least in my org, business leaders are not technical, and a lot of them aren't even very good at writing business proposals. This causes some frustration among the dev team that we aren't often pursuing best options. Also business owners are sometimes just yes-man to higher ups.

Mixed Quality of Team members: There is varied quality among all SDE levels. In some ways, SDE III still overrides SDE II decision even if other people don't agree.  Promotions are very political, and determined more by SDM/TPMs who don't even work with SDE on a day to day.

Managers do take good care of employees and offer flexibility as much as possible within their control.

Most were designed poorly by amateurs and then scaled aggressively to keep up with the cloud computing hype.  As a result, there's some catastrophic operational nightmare occurring at any given time of day within AWS, and some poor souls are scrambling to apply more bubble gum and baling wire. 



The company, AWS specifically, operates on the lone, hollow vision of ""make the customer happy"".  With no vision comes constant re-prioritizing of work, bike shedding, and conflict, which only makes getting anything significant done in an under-resourced, massive, and operationally-intensive environment that much more impossible.  Vision and long term strategy aren't valued, which makes sense given that a lot of the leadership seems to be context switching between outages, people management, and 3-6 month out feature launches.  Odds are that your work will be largely limited to putting out interesting fires or making something terrible last a bit longer.  That and perpetuating the thin public veneer of elegant automation at scale, which in actuality are crude scripts (see any number of high visibility outages) at best and clumsy human driven deployments, changes, and operational responses at worst. 



Talent, overall, is not great because of the self-perpetuating cycle of under-investment in hiring and its second order consequences: poorly designed and maintained systems that drove high operational burden and ultimately attrition.  Intelligent and capable folks have mostly gotten the read that Amazon is a miserable place to be, which only makes this feedback loop worse.  To keep the lights on through the last few years of cloud computing hype, AWS has hired a horde of low-bar, Enterprise-type characters that seem endemic to corporations well past their high point.  A lot of AWS is well past day 2.  Turf wars, kingdom building, and subcultures imported from other companies were increasingly visible.  



There are bright spots within the company, but not many and they are certain not to last.  If you do end up joining, do your best to determine the trajectory of both your service and manager and adjust accordingly.  Moving between teams seems to be the only way to outmaneuver some of the miserable circumstances within the company and is available to those not under-performing.  Research as much as possible before signing your offer.  Ask your hiring manager about vision/priorities, attrition, and expectations out of different roles within the team.  Ask about what their biggest fears and goals are, and determine if they’re serious and/or capable of addressing either.  Take care to get a good read on the manager’s relationship with the team and their style of leadership as sociopathic managers seemed to thrive and escape accountability in the chaos of AWS. ",

There are always times, as with any job, where you need to buckle down and put in the extra work.","The ""fail fast"" mantra of Silicon Valley does not apply. I have found that those in leadership roles take Amazon's ""Be Right, A Lot"" Leadership Principle quite literally. Failure of experiments is seen as such, a failure. It is not seen as a good thing in the teams I have been on. It is seen as a failure of the individual or team that proposed and implemented. 

Compensation and benefits are very much lacking. The financial compensation model is a black box that individual contributors have very little insight into. There have been various attempts to explain the financial compensation model at a high level but they have been unsuccessful. Base salary raises are quite small as the company sees RSU's as a major portion of total compensation. When stock prices rise there is no guarantee that new  RSU's will be rewarded. With volatility in Wall St, this is not comforting. 

There are many who prefer to see their careers grow over the success of projects or teams. It is not common for managers to stick up for individual contributors while presenting work for review to Director or VP level leadership. The 'top-down' management style and rule by fear is very apparent in some of the more mature business units across Amazon. 

Because of the size of the company, there is not a sense of community within the design discipline. There are attempts to do so but they come across as stale and self-righteous.",Push to understand the inputs into compensation and communicate these clearly with employees.

I get that question a lot and I always tend to sugarcoat the answer, but not anymore. This is what it's like to deliver for Amazon.... you start the day by loading 250 to around 350 packages which is any where between 150 to more than 200 stop. A stop can be anywhere from 1 to 5 different houses. Packages can weigh up to 50 pounds and majority of the time packages are not labeled heavy so there goes your back when your day starts. Packages a majority of the time come to us drivers already damages. You have no time for a lunch break (but you have to write down that you took one) and if your lucky you might get 1 of your 15 minute breaks. You have to choose whether or not you want to stay hydrated and choose between going and finding the closest bathroom and being called by dispatch to see why you are leaving your area or do what the guys do and pee in a bottle in the van. When an area is not accessible due to remodeling or anything and you let Amazon know and they forget they blame you for their mistakes instead of owning up to it. You get in trouble if the business is closed when you get there, or if the customer needs to sign for the packages but they arent home. You get in trouble for every package you have to bring back even if it's not your fault. Amazon asks you to give your feed back on everything to how they handle things, the routes, and the navigation system. Beware of giving feed back, they don't fix anything, they take routes anyway, maKe the navigation worse, and will some how find something to blame you for to give you a tier 1 infraction which will cost you your job. So next time you want to blame the driver for an issue with your package not being on time or damages.

Work life balance- There are NOT 10hr days/4 days a week. They expect more like 12-14hrs 4 days a week.

Lack of advancement- Despite being over qualified for my current position (tier 1 manager) the additional responsibility I take on and training I cannot seem to advance.

Favoritism (and not to the best managers, only the used car salesman, sleezy type. Senior leadership (L7 and above) have NO IDEA what we do in operations. I have had 4 regionals and 5 ops managers in a year and a half. They will say you can't go from an L4 manager to an L6 and a bunch of other made up ""rules"" but it's all fake. I've seen people fail interviews and be offered positions anyways, I've seen people slide into positions where there was never a posting, and I've seen L5 managers get L4 positions but continue to be paid as an L5 manager. The whole process and all the rules is a total joke.

Pay- This may be the biggest one so listen up. There is NO signing bonus and NO RSUs given to you for accepting the job. What they are giving you is your raises for the next 4 years.

After my first year I was supposed to  receive my 12k bonus ($1,000 per month for 12 months). When it came time for my annual raise I didn't get one because they take into consideration the ""bonus"" they give you and all RTUs (stock) that vests. Upon my second year I again did not receive an annual increase and was told that I was hired in at more than most L4 managers so again I wasn't receiving an annual increase. The $1,000 a month  I was getting as my bonus ended and now I'm not getting an increase. Correct... The 1st year I didn't receive an increase because they considered my signing bonus as my salary and now that it's gone, they don't consider it part of my salary. In short after 2 years I am now making 12k less then i did last year. I do have 6 RSUs  that vest this year and one might say that's why I didn't get in increase.. well.. 1. I was given these shares as part of my ""sign on"" and 2. The shares don't vest until NOVEMBER and it's April. For 7 months I will be living on a salary 1k a month less then what I made before.

Please listen to the reviews!! It's cool to say you work for Amazon for about the first year. After that you'll be embarrassed, I promise. Move on to the next potential employer and hope you can do 10 years + with them. Amazon will totally ruin your life and not set you up for the next opportunity.",I don't even know what to say. No one stays in their position long enough to make a difference. I've heard the term Churn and Burn in regards to our manager and it couldn't be true enough.

All after being threatened  to move from a 4 hour shift 5 days a week to a overnight 8 hour shift or the other option was to be fired. I switched over and ended up getting a hernia. I talked to several managers & the over the phone HR number to see what my options were because I physically couldn’t work the 8 hour shift but nobody could give me a straight answer. Managers told me to call the ERC (HR) number because they couldn’t do anything & the ERC was trying to force me to get workers comp & suggested I just go back & talk to the managers. Never once after a week and a half of putting in my medical wavier did any manager or HR person give me the advice that I needed to go about this situation.

I didn’t receive a termination notice/call or email until over 24 hour later & their reason for firing me said it was a voluntary withdrawal & I abandoned my shift & failed to contact managers. After being terminated I contacted a manager & they gave me an HR email address that could help me. I emailed them & got no response. A week later I called again & got the REAL HR email so I emailed them & got no response for days until I threatened to take legal action.

The breaks are ONLY two 30 minute long breaks, but it takes up to FIVE minutes just to get to the breakroom. This, adding the wait time or any possible mandatory activities going on, leaves you with roughly 10 minutes to eat or relax, before you're forced to get back to your stations; on top of that, you get in trouble if you 1: do not clock out AT THE EXACT TIME OF THE START OF THE BREAK (thus shortening your breaks even further) and 2: are not clocked back in BEFORE YOUR BREAK IS UP. The bosses at Amazon want you back at your station and working BEFORE your break ends! Another problem is the fact that you are not treated as a person. You're penalized for talking to other people, not meeting the ridiculously high quota set, and even going to the bathroom!! They don't care if you're sick, they want you to show up. I got sick with a high fever, vomiting, and dizziness. I called in to tell them and they said that they wouldn't let me stay home because I hadn't given them a notice at least 24 hours in advance. FOR BEING SICK. I had to come to work, sick, almost passing out, at risk of passing my sickness to the other workers or even customers through the inventory, having to go to the bathroom to vomit every once in a while. My boss came and talked to me about my TOT (time off task) because it was pretty bad. One look at me and he sent me home. The lack of movement and repetitive motions for TEN CONSECUTIVE HOURS actually messed up my back and my legs. Not to mention the fact that the inventory isn't always safe: at least twice this box of Tide detergent powder wasn't closed and burst open right into my face. I couldn't breathe, couldn't see; I thought I was going to die from it. There was no concern shared for me over this. The eye-washing stations are so spread out, as are the water stations, I didn't even know where the closest one could've been.

Amazon as an organization lies or misleads employees about its benefits and other factors like a politician might. You really have to investigate if a certain benefit is at the level of quality that they claim it is, or solves the problem they say it does. The majority of the time you discover there is a near-sociopathic decision that's been made in regard to how benefits are implemented or kept away from employees or customers. 
Managers' opinions are regarded as the word of god because Amazon believes they ""hire and develop the best"", it is impossible to succeed if you end up with one of the many many many many horrible managers. 
Payscale has been secretly increased throughout North America to levels of San Francisco and New York. Existing workers in SF and NY have not received a commensurate pay increase, nor have existing workers with more experience and contributions received an increase. Meanwhile, new employees with no experience or contributions are coming into non-SF and NY regions at $100k+ salaries to their peers. 
The majority of people do not stay long enough to get their stock equity. Amazon lies to employees about how your stock vests. If you get sick your stock will be delayed by the amount of time you got sick. When your stock vests enough taxes are not taken out and you will have to pay potentially 5 figures of back tax on your stock.","Fire 75% of middle managers, consolidate Levels 7-8 down to Level 7; make Level 6 Level 5s, and make Level 5s Level 4.

The Area Manager role is a very busy job, but with a lot of opportunity. 

You will always have a challenge ahead of you, and will never run out of work to complete. Due to the growth of the company, you will have unlimited growth potential, and Amazon is very open to moving you to any role as long as your talents match the position. The pay is very competitive, although it seems to be getting lower and lower every year. 

If you love work, and you love thinking about what is possible with any process or issue, this is absolutely the job for you. Look no further. If you can imagine it, and can provide the data to sell it, you can do it. 

I never imagined I would love operations and logistics, but I really enjoy my job. Those of us that are good enough to weed out all the things that aren't value added will have a great time here.","Work-life balance can often take a significant turn to the negative, specifically during holiday seasons. Operations seems to be the main place this occurs; yet, support program managers and other corporate entities are paid more than operations management, regardless of the extra work and direct-to-customer facing role. 

Even so, the biggest drawback of the job in the operations are all the petty, near-worthless duties you will have mostly due to HR policies. Let me be clear: an Area Manager is likely the busiest role in the company. You will have a lot to do, and not enough time to do it. Throughout this, you will receive a high amount of duties that I would consider short-term thinking, not matching the culture that Amazon has created; and most of it is due to HR policies. You will have to enter reports and checkmarks of things HR wants you to do that frankly make no difference in the long term at all. This wouldn't be an issue in itself, but an Area Manager has a significant amount of work to do, and these petty things add zero value to the work, and ZERO value to the associate experience. 

The company should really examine how much work the Area Manager role is being given, as it is always more and more, and a lot of it it useless. The role would be more useful if this was scrutinized.","I would suggest to revise what you want an Area Manager to do. Every month there seems to be more added, with nothing being taken away. The workload isn't the problem here, but the amount of things that don't add value to the customer or the organization.

Having been at Microsoft prior to Amazon, you don't get nearly as much of the contentious culture you see at Microsoft here at Amazon.  Team efforts are truly team efforts and everyone wants the company and their peers to succeed. 

Amazonians are smart people. You will not meet any incompetent people here. Unless you go to google or facebook, you'll realize just how high the Amazon caliber is as soon as you leave.","HR is shady - went to HR in confidence when I was having issues with my manager and she went directly to him. He confronted me the following day. 

Leadership/Management is shady -  there are several terrible managers here. Thankfully I only had to endure one during my time but one was too much. When I quit, he flagged me as ineligible for rehire even though I did not have any documented (or undocumented for that matter) performance issues. I heard from the team he was just furious when I left so this felt like retaliation. It took a lot of work but eventually after finding out about the flag, I had it removed. 

Work life balance is a joke - the rumors are true. While I was there, I interviewed for an internal role and the team I met with claimed they had great work life balance. When I asked what their typical office hours were they sad 8-630. In my book that's not great work life balance. That's normal Amazon hours.","Check your managers better. Check their firing history often. Too many managers there are determined to PIP folks out and saw this happen repeatedly during my years there. Keep an eye on this - if one manager is firing a lot of people, there's something to be said about that. 

HR practices need more integrity. I get they work for the company, not the employee but employees need a safe place to go to work through real issues. Amazon can burn you out easily. 

Keep an eye on managers better. They are not always right. Learn and be curious when it comes to a manager's negative review or evaluation of an employee. Check this opinion against previous managers. Do not just take the current manager's word for it. Get all the data including the insight from previous managers.

I was given two 15 min breaks and a 30 min lunch for 10-hour shifts and three 15 min breaks and lunch for 12 hours.
I never had issues using the restroom or getting water either. Most sites are on 4 day-10 hours per day schedule

Some big Pros:
1. Full Benefits Day 1 
  1a. A total of 168 hours of time off options each year
   80 hours of unpaid time off, 20 hours each quarter
   48 hours of paid time off, earned based on hours worked
   40 hours of paid vacation, earned based on hours worked.
   Plus during non-busy times you can opt to go home without pay for no penalty 
   I feel this is a generous amount and the most I heard of for new employees.
2. $15 Per Hour (Recently Raised)
3. Daily food trucks arranged (This was at my site, others may vary)
4. Once a month or so they would buy lunch (pizza, Chik-fil-a, etc) for everyone
5. Peak Season (Nov-Dec) prizes, awards for attendance, and performance
6. Climate controlled 81 degrees max in the summer, 50-70 in the winter
7. Communicated overtime in advance of at least 24 hours
    7a. At most, you worked 5 days a week if needed.

Warehouse work is not for everyone, I have worked in several warehouses Amazon has some pretty easy positions. Most of the time boring, standing in one place but easy.
There are performance and quality rates to maintain, some people struggle, and some people excel. It is fairly easy to maintain these rates at a steady pace. This pretty much sums it all up.","Couple downsides, however, you will find this with most warehouses.
1. Despite the nationwide pay increase to $15 still low for how successful Amazon is.
2. Poor management, some better than others though.
3. Drama, even with some of the management. (This is typical with most companies)

I hope you don't have a shy bladder.   
 Your time on the clock is completely micromanaged to the nanosecond; you'll not only be on your feet for ten hours a day, but when you get one of your two 15-minute breaks, you have to walk as fast as you know how to walk to get where you have to go; there's a three minute walk to break room, then you have to time the coffee machine to brew your cup while you run and get another cup full of ice so you can cool your coffee off enough to drink it since you can't bring it on the floor. You might shove a granola bar down your throat with the coffee, run to the restroom, and then back to your station so you can start picking again at exactly 15 minutes after your break began. 

Going to lunch involves waiting until exactly 12 to sign out of station, then walk three minutes to swipe out for lunch at 12:03. Upon return from lunch you'll need to attend the daily afternoon Stand-Up (required meeting) at 12:35, and since you can't sign in before you've been on lunch for 30 minutes, you'll have to wait until 12:33 to swipe back in and then run up the stairs to the third floor for the Stand-Up.

* There's always something new to learn and there is a mixture of all kinds of roles from more scientific and research based to hard core system optimization as well as solving new and interesting business problems, so whatever problems you like to solve, Amazon likely has something in that realm.  
* You are allowed to move between teams pretty much as often as you like.  If you end up with a bad manager or unreasonable work pace, you can work with HR to find something more your speed.
* Amazon compensates employees in stock, and the stock has been doing amazing the past 5 years.  
* Amazon is very flexible with dedicated and long-time employees.  My wife got a job that required us to move across the country, and so I was able to start working from home (after 5 years at Amazon) while flying back to visit the main office in Seattle once a month or so.  
* The company operates as thousands of tiny little start ups.  Each team has it's own set of goals and goes through rapid iterative development cycles, which makes for a fun environment.  The advantage of being in a giant company like Amazon in this situation is that you can then leverage many of the tools and services that others have built and vend to you to make this even faster!","* Churn of people moving teams and in and out of company make it a little difficult to persist knowledge and keep full team momentum moving forward, but you can find teams that stick together for quite some time as well, it just depends.  
* Compensation is good compared to the software industry as a whole, but compared to other tech companies, it is slightly behind.

The team I was on had fun, quirky people
Extremely lgbtq friendly (in this one regard, it was a very safe space)
Dogs in office (it was somehow awful in spite of dogs everywhere)
Great location downtown","Management/Poor work distribution within teams creates incredibly toxic environment. 

You will be limited by your manager’s skills/experience. After being promoted, I was assigned to report to someone with no supervisory experience. I was given no core responsibilities, no recurring tasks, and a vague job description of about 250 words. My manager possessed little to no awareness of my day to day, my work output, or the hours that went into one-off projects I took on. When I asked for more structure/development, I was simply told it was on me to create my own opportunities and the level of structure I was seeking was beneath someone in my (almost entry level) role. My peers retained high levels of support under an actual people manager, while the momentum it took me almost 3 years to cultivate came to an abrupt halt and my career at Amazon nose dived. 

After many months of working up to 12 hours a day and on weekends (as a casual employee), trying to build a role from scratch and regain relevance to my team, my boss put me on a coaching plan for what was reluctantly alluded to as “difficulty handling role ambiguity.” Ambiguity was a strength of mine; what the plan implicitly addressed was my increasing frustration/pushback at working all hours and not receiving recognition on par with peers (I would have settled for a fraction of it).

At this point, the misery ramped up, as I was at my computer every waking moment, and there was very little left to give. My manager remained unaware of the volume or quality of the work, while continuing to assert I was underperforming (with no numbers or examples to support this). I got stress hives, migraines, panic attacks, and eventually broke down crying in-office when my boss formally documented an initiative of mine as insubordination, after he simply misremembered a conversation. My reaction to this, saying “what?!” on our internal chat, was characterized as overly aggressive. (He characterized other people as aggressive, too; it was not surprising he perceived people this way as his behavior tended to engender frustration.)

The inevitability I’d been fighting from day one came to fruition when almost everyone at my level was advanced in a sweep of restructuring, and I was informed my role “lacked scope for advancement” (an assessment made by someone who seemed to possess little knowledge of my role or how it compared to that of peers.) This all happened right after being promoted and specifically told I’d *finally* be getting the recognition and visibility I deserved. His only other direct report was similarly set up to fail. I do speculate management will decide to treat this as a coincidence and let him continue leading people’s careers down dead ends.

If you are indifferent to the work or advancing here, you may actually do great. If you are passionate about the work, it will be a struggle, as advancement, opportunity, challenges, etc., have more to do with luck than merit, and you will watch projects you are passionate about be allocated to people that don’t even want them (this pattern was by far the hardest aspect of the job).

Basically. if you don’t have an experienced manager loudly shouting about your achievements and how great you are from day one, save yourself time and pain and keep your resume up to date.","First of all, if the “exit interview” had been more than an e-survey with an extremely restrictive word count, I probably would not have posted this here.

Secondly, advancement at Amazon had little to do with given employees’ work or potential; it is almost entirely a reflection of a manager’s ability to manipulate a rigid, unintuitive system. It seems to take many managers over a year just to learn how the system works, as great employees are fed misleading expectations and their careers stalled. Please be more transparent and stop wasting years of people’s lives with false expectations set by inexperienced managers. Workers want to thrive; if you actually let them know how they can within your system, they will. Job responsibilities and expectations shouldn’t feel like an existential enigma.

Please provide more extensive training for new supervisors, perhaps making it clear that it is more than simply being an IC with mentees? My supervisor seemed to think his job exclusively entailed telling me to I had to create my own opportunities. He leaned heavily on the team’s people manager to execute tasks like delivering feedback (even to me), managing internal team politics, checking in on a regular basis (e.g., stopping by the room to say “hi”), driving team building, identifying professional development opportunities, etc. He seemed indignant at the notion these are things he should be involved in. There were times I literally sat in our workspace alone, while peers participated in professional development opportunities I was not looped in to because my boss didn’t seem to regard this as a piece of his role. (Sitting in that space alone,  wondering where everyone went felt just as pathetic as it sounds.)


Please make it more clear there are avenues for sending feedback for new managers that have very few direct reports. This would have been a much better experience if I hadn’t felt it was just me against a team of managers defending their own. Further, because this person was not a “full” manager, he seems to have faced no accountability for his actions with regard to this aspect of his position. During my final weeks, he was promoted as an IC in spite of his performance (or lack thereof) as a supervisor; meanwhile, his dabbling in management ended my future with the company."

This is not a company that realizes that its true worth comes from the people that work for them. This is a company that is obsessed about itself and its so called Leadership principles, however the company today is a faint image of its former self, given that most of the class A talent, those who joined the company when it was truly a Day One company, have left the company and moved on to better pastures. Many of the leaders that are left behind are Tier B or Tier C, especially VPs and Directors who have remained VPs and Directors 10-12 years since joining Amazon. Much of the success of the company is attributed to Jeff Bezos, however the fact remains that his wife, Mackenzie, has been very key and instrumental to making Amazon what it became, being that she paid close attention to the daily workings of the company and many of the Customer facing ideas came from her (many can and will attest to her involvement of the day to day). The current situation rips open the mystique of JeffB and lays bare the fact that he is no super human, and he owes his success to the efforts of many of those who worked for him, toiling many late hours, and didn't get to enjoy the benefits commensurate to their efforts.","Grow in your humility and integrity or face tough days ahead.

1) In the first year itself i was awed by the shear intelligence of folks around. Due to the high bar of hiring, Amazon tends to hire smartest workforce and that's why i have always had learning opportunities from 360 degrees. There are people who are much junior to you and yet are smart and there are folks above you who you can learn from. Which is unique to all other employers i have had.

2) As my journey continues with Amazon i started loving the fact that promotions and raises are tightly tied to performance. Promotions are a rigorous process but if you are a good performer then all falls in place for you. Politics does not play in, the processes and mechanisms in place ensure that the deserving folks get to the next level. The icing on the cake in there in no time in role requirement to get to next level. If you can perform at next level, you will get there.

3) Last and most important reason that i have started appreciating in last couple of years is that the yearly planning process in bottoms up. I most companies the goals are decided up top and then they flow down. Not true here ! At Amazon, each teach team decides its own fates and proposes what great things it will do next year and then that planning process flows upwards. Which gives tech teams autonomy to do stuff which makes it super unique.","The first year at Amazon can be difficult sometimes. Mostly with the fact that it has a unique culture of rigor as well as people being brutally honest. If you put together a poor quality doc (no presentations at amazon) for a review, you will be told that in the meeting. If you cant deal with it (which is difficult at start) then you will have issues. The best way to deal with this is to first get a mentor who can help you see through these situations. Next try to imbibe the Amazon leadership principles, they are amazing and if you see things through the lens of these principles then you will understand why people behave in the way they do.",

For example, if you try to look up the company's phone number in their KC(internal database of all their policies), logically you would think they would have ""company phone number"" as a keyword, when you type that, you get no result; instead the keyword is ""phase phone"".   When you have to resolve a call quickly, and obvious keywords dont help; it is frustrating. If you contact a Supervisor for quick help (because all keywords you type in KC dont help), Amazon counts that against you.  Amazon has so many departments to transfer customers to, but every other week the name of the department changes (of course, the new name of the department may takes weeks or months before it appears in KC, so you have to call around, which prolongs customers' wait time). Their policies on how to resolve a particular problem are deliberately ambiguous so that they can use it against you, when doing performance review. The mainframe you use to resolve customers issues (returns/refund/payments/ a-to-z claims) changes so often without any regards on how it may affect agents efficiency on a call; worst of all no updates to notify you that that something you use to see for many years, now as a different abbreviated name and steps to resolve.  Now that the company raised the minimum wage to 15, they are using all of these ambiguities in their system and policies to get rid of agents (which means the really could not afford to raise wages, but by doing that they win favors with many people and few people will focus on the fact that they only raised the wage to protect the company's image from the divorce and mistress scandal). Oh, I forget, I cant remember the number of software and processes and change in teams I have experiences in one year; every new software has a life span of a few months and then you have to learn new one for reason that should I have been thought out well in advance during the UX development phase.","Hire people who have direct experience in the line of work their staff is doing.   Many Managers have the mentality of a brick and mortar Manager; with most issues that need to be managed being technical issues (people with soft skills and little technical skills should be expected to have real technical skills to able to report confidently most of your internal technical issues that agents face a lot while trying to serve customers). It is not sensible for a Manager to write up their staff for technical issues that they could avoid by looking at their data reports  and by doing real data analytical work. Managers with no real technical and direct job related knowledge are obviously forced to blame their employee for problems they cant solve.  Getting rid of an employee for their poor ability to do their end of their job only helps the Manager to keep their job longer at the expense of the employee. If you are going to let Managers be in their position (simply because you like them ) then the data they use to evaluate employees should be made available to the employee so that they can manage or help themselves.  When the technical tools (only they can see and manipulate to their favor) they misinterpret affect the agents, then you are creating a  work culture that values keeping and promoting employees because you like them, not because they are hardworking."

In previous jobs I worked the same daily hours with a 5th or 6th day and calls after I got off work.","As I have read there are many people with a focus on themselves and their own agenda.  So yes there are issues with the culture as a whole. However, as a leader you can set the culture in your own department and shape how your peers and senior leaders interact with you. Culture is everyone's responsibility. 401k is not good, 1/2% match up to 4% for a max of 2%.",With every interaction with senior leadership culture and safety seem to be the priority.

- Likely to get to work on areas that are 1 inch wide and a mile deep - thinking about your impact on the product and ask yourself, is that the way you'd like to grow in your career?

- Lots of mid-level managers that abuses the power to keep themselves afloat (unfortunately an issue not getting enough attention from the high-level managers and since the turn over rate is so high, there won't be a shortage of applicants, so your feedback are likely to get ignored as a new hire)

- A grinding place: systematic overuse of new hires, it's team dependent, but your likelihood to get burn out is much higher than the other tire one tech companies

- Definitely not a company culture that encourages interpersonal communications (to run the scale Amazon has, the company prioritizes process, guidelines, and documentation over human connections - ask yourself is that the way you like to work?)

- Most people just think about themselves and how to climb up the career ladder, as the turn over rate is so high, no one really cares to have long-term thinking  for your career or the product 

- The review system is corrupted: People learn how to game the system and sometimes even use it to bring down their peers or go up

 - You will get to work on products with lots of traffic, but many of which will have no visibility to end users (if you cares about this)

- If you enjoy working with people that have a true appreciation of user experience and design, this is not the place for you, although you will learn a good deal of business execution","Limit the power of mid-level managers, who abuses them for self-interest"

Far more challenging to move from Tier III to Tier IV, requiring years of experience and a proven track record of being above and beyond as a tier III.
- Use of broad ""tiers"" for a number of different jobs considered on the same level reduces wages and opportunities to move up past tier III.
- Heavily chaotic, not particularly well-organized warehouses. Lack of consistent direction and a lot of wasted effort, resources. Good opportunity to excel and get noticed as a Process Assistant is building processes to make order of the chaos; however, clear organization is not the norm and you may encounter significant pushback.

Almost everything is done online. Admire the women that do the same work as the men. I felt sorry for the Managers, they were nice and only doing what their computer told them to do. They pay you overtime, the time it takes to walk to the time clock from your station at the end of your shift. When you are new they will ask you how you like it, and not get on you about productivity.  Free  coffee and hot chocolate. Unlimited gloves. Free computers to
use at break. Video games in the break room. Free parking. Personal locker with lock. Chairs to sit in during break and lunch. Onsite human resources for any concerns. No need to carry electronics of any kind inside the warehouse. Cool robots working like slaves. Smoking allowed inside the smoke room. Weekly pay at my site. Extra pay for working nights.

Back breaking work lifting and moving heavy boxes continuously for your whole shift. It was called building pallets. Put boxes on pallets so that they can be shipped to their next destination.  It felt eerily like the book ""1984"", you are constantly being monitored and surveyed. The scanner would ask ""Is your manager focused on safety?"" And then you are suppose to pick an answer. It felt like being in a prison. the buzzer tells you when it's time for break or lunch or end of shift. It would take me exactly 7 minutes to walk to the time clock. I would not do this job if it paid $20 per hr. Some coworkers would just do the easy work, scan the smallest boxes, throw boxes onto the pallets, not take time to close out the pallets because they only care about their rate. (No. of boxes scanned per hr). At manual pallets everyone could work at any conveyor so no one had any accountability if the pallets were organized, lopsided or who is scanning the huge boxes. After 2 days of training you are on your own to figure it out. I quit after my 1st real day. I would have quit before then but the women I went through training with had toughed it out. I almost felt guilty until I remembered that I hired on at will which means they can fire me at will, and I can quit at will. I suspect that the ibuprofen in the machines at amazon are just sugar pills.","They are already aware of what is going on, constantly get new people in and get out the tired ones. What they might not be aware of is that these workers are also consumers. I have been an amazon customer since 2003. I am canceling amazon prime and will probably never order anything again. Not everyone who gets a job at amazon is desperate and poor. I have been with my government job for 29 yrs. I feel for the poor souls that have no choice and work their fingers to the bone and hope that they will eventually move up to a better job but in the end will probably be fired because they aren't productive enough.

I enjoyed having a team and PA's that respected, supported, and worked hard for me. Definitely an experience to be thrown in the fire by inheriting the worst team in the building and having the privilege of witnessing their growth into one of the best teams. I did everything I could to treat them well despite the work environment and iniquitous culture. In addition, you'll be stepping into a role with tremendous responsibility and actually learn a few things such as your level of patience and the type of person you really are. I had so ""many"" good things to say about this company that I forgot to mention the decent pay + bonuses and advancement opportunities.","Let's start off with what I have NEVER experienced with any company. 

- NEVER have I seen a group of AM's that are friends try to tear each other's heads off and point fingers for their team's poor performance with Ops Managers just watching.
- NEVER have I met leaders that deliberately try to humiliate and yell at you in front of everyone just because they can. Seriously, is that your method of teaching and being a role model? 
- NEVER have I been directed by the senior team to write my associates up for random bs just because they're having a bad day performance wise. 
- NEVER have I worked at a place that allows you to chew and spit tobacco while on the floor.
- NEVER have I worked for a company where power is abused and you can literally be blamed for anything and everything that you have no control over. 
- NEVER have I met so many freaking 2 faced individuals. Act like your best friend one minute because they needed help with something and then turn around and throw you under the bus.
- NEVER have I witnessed so much bullying. Racist comments, lets see who's bigger and badder, make girls and even some guys cry because. . . well you ain't ever gonna learn if I don't sh*t on you. 

You get the point. Come work for Amazon! I've never worked somewhere so toxic. You'll work 12-13 hours everyday (more if you're not up to par), not eat or drink anything for 10 hours just to end your day by getting treated like dog sh- feces. I've stayed there for almost a year (only stayed that long because of my team) when the average tenure is about 6 months. The leadership principles, the values, the culture - all of it is a bunch of crap. You can recite the bs but what are they if they're just words and you hire incompetent people that can't comprehend it?

They are obsessed with how quickly you can perform your job. I work in packing, we are expected to pack 227 items per hour (individual items, not complete boxes). That’s approximately 3 items per second. The starting rate was only 150, but they keep pushing it higher and higher and setting their own employees up for failure. And they WILL hold you to that ridiculous standard. I was written up for only being 85% to rate. 85% of 227 is not good enough for these people.

Everything single you do is recorded by your workstation down to the last second. This includes leaving your station for something like using the bathroom. I once had a manager come up to me and complain that I was TWO MINUTES late getting back from lunch. When I told them it was because I use the bathroom after break, they told me not to do that. I’m not exaggerating. This company penalizes its employees for their bodily functions.

We get two 30 minute breaks every day. That may sound fine, but BOTH breaks count for travel time. So in the time it takes to leave my station, go through security, get to my locker, grab my belongs, and then go back to my locker considerably cuts down on my actual break time.

You are encouraged to leverage your areas of strength to contribute, and you really have the opportunity to manage your career, but you are responsible for managing your career... nobody is going to do that for you.  Everyone I've engaged with has been great in helping me to ramp, but I'm responsible for doing my homework ahead of time and engaging people to answer questions.  This isn't a company where someone is going to walk up to you and say, how can I help you, but if you initiate, they will be responsive.  My caveat to that is that your manager does have a responsibility to help you to ramp, and I've experienced that to varying degrees in the roles I've taken.  Some managers are much better at the ""develop the best"" portion of that leadership principle than others.  No matter the level, I've found that you are made to feel like you make a difference... because you do.  It doesn't feel like you're part of a big machine even though you're one of many, many employees.   Often I've been in meetings where the conversation can get heated, very strong points of view are shared, and it's very contained to that meeting or that conversation.  People value differing points of view as long as they're substantive or backed by some rationale, in other words, don't talk just to talk... it won' t win you any points.  The caliber of individuals I've had the opportunity to work with is mind-blowing.  You really do feel like you're working with the best of the best.  I love that the Leadership Principles are things we live and breathe every day at every level and not just some abstract or meaningless charters.  These are principles we are expected to use to measure ourselves and the way we look at the performance of others.  I also believe in the senior leadership of the organization, Jeff and his S-Team.","Some managers aren't great at developing people, and it is harmful to the individual especially when they're new.  The depth and consistency with which performance feedback is delivered varies dramatically from team to team, and that's something that needs to be worked on.

It varies from team to team, but we talk a lot at the company about work-life harmony, but sometimes I feel like leadership and managers are talking out of both sides of their mouth.  It is expected that you ruthlessly prioritize so this company doesn't eat you alive, and that's with any company that is operating at the scale of Amazon.  There is always more work to do and it's the responsibility of the employee to prioritize and to align on that prioritization with their management.  It's also understandable that there are ebbs and flows, some times you're working all night when it's really busy but that is supposed to be offset with times which are lighter.  I think leadership doesn't do a great job of listening sometimes when an employee says, ""stop,"" it's too much.  I've seen it happen where there's always one more and one more and one more thing to do, and management has said ""well it all needs to get done but it will get lighter when..."", and that ""when"" doesn't come.  People, particularly people that are new or more junior, I've seen get worried that a ""no"" will be viewed as ""I will hurt my chances of promotion"" or ""I will create a negative perception or hurt a relationship with my partners/customers.""

Amazon is not a company where the word ""promotion"" is well-received from my experience.  Advancement can mean increase in scope or a new opportunity, but the ""path to promotion"" is too abstract in many areas.  We have leveling guidelines to help you measure your performance and what the expectations are at the other levels but I've found that many mangers aren't great about aligning your strengths and areas of opportunity to those in a way that indicates when, if, or how you may be ready for promotion.  It is a flat organization, and everyone I know has leveled down in terms of title to come work here, and that's okay, but promotion should not be made to feel like it's a taboo or bad word.  You don't get promoted into a role here (i.e. if you're a manager, you don't go from Manager to Sr. Manager just by applying to a Sr. Manager role), you do well at your level and either 1.  Get promoted in your role and then are expected to rotate into a role at that new level 2. have a current role that can be scoped at a higher level and then they level you up in your role and you can stay in that role 3.  Apply to a higher level scoped role (1 level higher max) and are expected to perform at that higher level for x months and then get promoted.  The con of that is that it varies from organization to organization within the company and sometimes from team to team on how that works and the transparency around that is not great at all. Sometimes people say you can't get a promotion unless there is a role of that same level open in that organization or the team, in other teams that's not the case.  It's super confusing.  The upside is that once you are up for promotion, the process is really good from  my POV because it's not based on one person's experience.  At a high level the concept is that a document is put together where your manager puts you up for promotion and you also have feedback from your partners supporting that promotion.","Create more transparency around the promotion process and the development of employees to get them ready for promotion.  Don't make them feel like it's a taboo topic.  If a milestone for an individual is to get promoted, we understand promotion is not the only thing, but it is a thing, so have the conversation... help us, and be clear about what it takes to get there with, to whatever degree possible, tactical, tangible achievements that help to support that.

Be better about enforcing work-life harmony.

You work actively on hiring and developing more women and diverse candidates/employees.  You've focused a lot on hiring and retention, but I'm not clear on how we're being helped as existing employees on the promotion portion of that objective and what our KPIs are.  Promote more from within.  You've hired the best... promotion is one of several measures of development, so promote."

Amazon does not pay cash bonuses. Amazon pays RSUs when you sign-on with the company. Each year you would expect to get some type of RSU or bonus compensation and this is not the case. Being with the company for several years I have yet to see an additional share or RSU grant. The company has not paid one dollar in bonus money and if you are considered a highly valued on your evaluation you will only receive a 1% increase to your salary.

This is truly unfortunate as many other companies have great compensation packages. When you sign on with a six-figure RSU package understand that this is considered part of your compensation package. Your RSUs won’t completely vest until four years. At this time you will see managers run for the hills not looking back at such a horrendous company. This is why Amazons turnover will always be high. Like everyone else I am waiting for my 4 year vest. On the day this vesting occurs I will vacate the company and not look back. I have seen managers run for the hills prior to the four year vest leaving over 200k on the table. From speaking with these individuals the theme is common...it’s not worth losing your sanity.

Amazon does not value feedback or want any type of feedback from managers. If you have a backbone and disagree and commit you will have a target on your back.",Truly reevaluate your compensation package for managers. Bonuses should be paid in cash and RSU grants should be standard regardless of how well the stock is performing.

Leadership principles are not the only thing that should matter. Concerns of your workforce matter just as much. Contradiction is apparent of this.

Those with a high caliber work ethic should be recognized, not chastised. Implore associates to do their best, help them where they falter - fill in the gaps and move forward on a goal as a cohesive unit. 

One site's issues does not speak for an entire company but it gives a bad impression through word of mouth. Micromanagement is a serious issue that needs to be removed from the work environment altogether. The CEO should be fully aware of lowered morale at various sites caused by micromanagement. Intervention of HR when reporting issues is lacking.  All of these elements create a formula to drive one to seek employment elsewhere."

2. Reasonable pay if you ignore the fact that you work 12+ hours a day (sometimes even more than that).","1. No work-life balance - I've worked 12+ hours each day in Amazon. There were a couple of months that I even worked for 14-16 hours a day + weekends.
2. No growth opportunities.
3. Poor benefits compared to other top tier companies.
4. Managers aren’t in Amazon are not to be trusted – 
Your manager will tell you anything to make you join his team and make you work harder. But from my experience managers in Amazon aren’t on your side. For example: During my 1.5 years in Amazon I had 5 managers (yes, 5!). The first manager was the one that recruited me. Back then Amazon gave me an SDE 2 offer although I was a senior in some other leading company. That manager together with his director, told me not to worry. They told me that Amazon give sde 2 to almost everyone, but then they promote senior people after 6-12 months. Shortly after I joined Amazon I discovered that there was no truth in these claims (even if you ranked high as I did there was absolutely no chance for that to happen). In fact, 3 months after I joined my first manager already left so that promise faded into the air.
5. Unbelievable amount of politics -
As I described managers in Amazon aren’t to be trusted. They are all about slaving their employees so they can move up the ladder faster. After a year in Amazon I came to my 5 (and last manager) and asked him about the promised promotion. My last manager told me that in Amazon, if you want to get promoted, you need to “play the politics”. You need to find ~6 engineers to support you. Later on the same manager told me in one of our 1-1s that in order to get his support for my promotion, I need to kill one of my side project and give it to him so he can present it as his own initiative.
There is also a lot of politics on the peers level (which I won't describe here).
6. Lack of diversity – yes, unfortunately that also exist in Amazon. My division had a clear preference for engineers that came from a certain country. All of the managers and senior engineers in our division came from that country. I personally didn’t think it’s a coincidence.
7. Pay is only reasonable if you ignore the fact that you work 12+ hours a day. In fact, strong engineers can find way better offers at every other leading company pretty much.",

The great part is that I lost a lot of weight since I started with Amazon and I have been much more active. If you have a positive attitude, working at Amazon will be a piece of cake. If you’re the type of person that gets frustrated easily, this probably isn’t the job for you. 99% of my job consists of training people how to figure out things for themselves (autonomy) and holding people accountable for when they do not do their job.","Long hours.

Pay - there philosophy is to pay low, give you a fairly decent sign on bonus for year 1 (mine was $25k) and then an additional sign on bonus for year 2 (mine was $20k) as well as some stocks that do not vest for 5 years.  It is the way to try and keep people through at least the 2 year mark.  Merit increases are fairly non existent and if you do get one it is in the range of 1%.  Oh and if you leave before the 1 year mark is up you owe the remaining money back, which makes sense, but no one tells you that while you are still there, they wait a few weeks after your end date and then just send you an email which what you owe and tell you it due in 30 days.  

Career opportunity - everything is by level and if you interview for an internal position that is a level above you they will downgrade that position.  All it means is that you have opportunity to get promoted if they feel down the road you are doing a good job.  I am not sure why anyone would do the work of a level above them but only get paid their same amount.  And even if that is the case they need to be telling  employees that in the interview process not at the time of the offer for the new position.  (Oh by the way it will be a lateral move.)

Restructure -- the workforce staffing team went through 3  restructures in less than a year.  The individuals in Seattle are making the changes but not engaging the staff that are actually doing the tactical work to ensure that it make sense.
All in all I think that they have a lot of work to do when it relates to how they treat their employees, everyone is so focused on the next best thing that they have lost sight of the fact that you can't make it to the next best thing without employees.  They are your biggest investment.

- Lots of office locations offers a good chance to work where you want to
- Good resume boost (much greater response rate to job applications after I worked at Amazon)
- Got to work on multiple teams doing entirely different things, meaning I got diversity in office locations, products I worked on, and culture
- Lots of smart co-workers. I learned a ton about how tech is developed at scale. Bezos, of course, is a genius. 
- The smaller offices that are relatively under the radar have much less ""Amazonian"" culture which, sadly, is a good thing
- Stock price is doing well, meaning RSUs are worth more (although if this means your are above your comp ""target"" they cut down on bonuses, etc. What a great thanks for all the hard work!)
- Very product oriented, meaning you get to more clearly see the business/product impact and motivations behind tech. 
- Non-technical people are especially impressed when you say you work at Amazon. To a regular, non-tech person, Amazon seems to be more impressive than Google or Facebook, even though in the tech world the latter are considered more impressive.","- Lack of empathy for employees or sense of mission for doing good for the world. This has been a core cultural value from the start, as I learned from ""The Everything Store"" and other histories of Amazon (e.g., Steve Yegge's blog posts)
- Lots of small, employee antagonistic policies--non-competes (I've seen INTERNS have to sign 18 month non-competes), clawing back 2/3 of that year's 401K match when you leave (and it's already an industry low 2%), 5-15-40-40 vesting schedule with the 40s vesting as 20 per 6 months...compare this to the standard 25-25-25-25 vesting schedule with monthly vesting after the first year.
- Rather stingy/subpar benefits compared to other big tech companies
- Inadequate investment in onboarding. Google and Facebook have 4-6 week bootcamps for new engineers. Amazon...has either a 1 day orientation in Seattle (which sometimes they'll fly out people from other offices, sometimes not), or a subpar wiki you follow on your own. 
- Lots of janky internal tooling that the company has not invested enough in. Again, I hear about the internal tooling at FB/Google and drool a bit. The downside of a tech company not run by engineers, though the upside is speed and business/product decisions are more emphasized so you can learn more about that.
- Frugality Leadership Principle means inane things like paying interns six figure annualized salaries but not paying $25 for a single checked bag on their flights or Lyfts to the airport, no free food but okay with highly paid engineers spending a long time going out to get lunch, sometimes subpar backpacks, stingy $100 annual employee discount only after you spend $1000 on items shipped and sold from Amazon (which is less than half), no free Prime, etc.
- Warehouse Employees are treated horribly (just Google it), and the little antagonistic policies make it clear they'd treat us engineers like that if they could. Dystopian when Jeff Bezos is the world's richest man
- Corporate and bureaucratic at larger offices
- Kool aid/cult-like obsession with Leadership Principles which end up weaponizing them, since multiple LPs oppose each other (""Dive Deep"" vs ""Bias for Action"") so just about anything can be justified or opposed via the LPs. Not as bad as the cult around, say, consulting companies like McKinsey but still kinda bad. 
- Very inconsistent experiences across teams and orgs. Some teams I was on were absolutely wonderful and amazing, others were miserable. This is true to some extent in all big companies but much more so at Amazon. It really is roulette.","Adopt empathy as a core Leadership Principle. Customer Obsession is empathy for your customers, but the lack of empathy means high turnover and people, like me, who only use Amazon as a quick stepping stone to get to a company where they actually feel valued. Stop being stingy (I mean uh...""frugal"") because it saves a trivial amount of money relative to the salaries being paid but seriously hurts morale (add free Prime, better employee discounts, more swag and company events, catered lunch). There's a difference between true Frugality and this."

40 hour of vacation time, increased each year. 
New 15$ base pay for tier 1. Mean less chance of getting fired since they got rid of seniority pay and now everyone is a the same level. 
UPT time that you can used at any time. 
After staying for a year you can take certain classes for certain job field that amazon will pay for you. (up to 95%)","Favoritism (promotion, position transfer, peak prize, ""random drawing"") 

Safety is preached but it not truly carried out. The warehouse is generally messy and dirty. 
Funny story, tier 1 now only get 2 gloves for a 4 day work week but during peak people worked 5 to 6 day a week. So people had to wash their gloves or waste time asking manager (4) or pa(3) to get a new pair of gloves. 
Funny story 2 Tier 5/6 manager make FSI but they don't actually try to make sure the building is clean, they do it asap so they can go home 

Rate- If you don't make rate you get a write up. Multiple write up mean termination. Plus Amazon goal isn't actually to keep tier 1 associate for long term, thus Manager (4) don't have any ability to incentives (lack of prize, fund, free food)  or motivate associate beside fear of being fired. Plus no one actually follow the amazon way of doing thing  100%  in certain path since you can't make rate if you do.  So when the manager do a audit and see how you are doing everyone has to do the ""safe and 100% amazon way"" but then go back to the rate way. It a joke how everyone know the process is strange but the manager have to do the audit since it a part of their job and it make no sense rate wise or safety wise.  

Promotion - Even though theoretically it suppose to be 60% promote within and 40% outside hire. The opposite is true hence low morale. If you do well at your job it unlikely you get a promotion or a transfer to a different job path. Even though the GM(8) and the board states if you have a  college degree you can apply for a tier 4 manager position, it very unlikely. Amazon expect if you come into amazon as a tier 1 you have to move up the ladder as a tier 3 then to a tier 4 etc. (they don't tell you on the website or anything, a manager told us that) It more likely for someone to leave amazon get a degree and then come back to get a tier 4 faster then someone to get promote from a tier 1. The fastest from tier 1 to tier 3 then a tier 4 is 2 and half year but you have to know people. Most people who started Miami and Orlando 2018 building were either new college hire or those who worked for amazon for a few month, left and got a degree in whatever and then came back and got hired as a tier 4. PA3 people tend to stay in position for a long time and  tend to teach the new college hire tier 4 how to do their job and for most of the time are actually the one running the team. Few are ever promoted to tier 4 since amazon tend to keep people who do their job well in same position for years instead of promoting them. Hence getting a tier 3 position take time but staying as a tier 3 and waiting for a tier 4 promotion from within the company is even longer. 

Culture- Amazon Organization Behavior  is really strange. Since Manager and above (4-8) stress high productivity but don't have any mean or wiliness to give anything for tier 1 & 3 when team and building performance is reach or goes above quota. Only thing that is given is empty praise. Our team is number 1 or out building is number 1 in the network etc. Plus teamwork is stress but those who go above don't get promoted instead they are usually stuck in position for years.   Indirect role path people  are treated worst incentive wise  even though they are key to success to those in path. Of course amazon consider those people to not actually help amazon making money doesn't help. 

peak- schedule is confusing and can be different from the online schedule and what is stated in the building. Tier 1/& 3 have to be extra careful to follow the exact schedule cause if you miss a day you lose time. If you work an extra day and it add up to more then you are allowed to worked in a week you get a write up 

HR is nice to certain people, but it doesn't always show mercy when some people have a medical issue, and  thus they are fired.  Plus they aren't great at setting up the schedule.",

I have seen engineers whom just got out of ivey league schools get fired, I have seen young adults whom just bought a home close to the office get fired, and I have seen father's of multiple children get fired.

Amazon creates a toxic culture where you are just trying your best to out perform the weakest link on your team and so because you don't want to be the weakest, you either keep pushing or you get burntout and go elsewhere.   I have seen women crying at their desks from the stress they are being put on from micromanagement, living in shared housing to afford Bay area cost of living. 

There are daily stand up meetings where you have to announce to the team all the things you are working on, and they vote on how much your workload is truly worth.  It's just another way for management to give you more work without you fighting back.

Company holidays and team building events are very minimal, Amazon is really great at being as frugal and cheap with their employees.

Not a friendly environment, when you get hired you will be in an exciting, ambitious, enthusiastic mood that will give you the motivation to work hard, but a year into it you will see how many people leave and how many people are asked to leave.  Amazon doesn't mind because they get the most amount of value from you for the least amount of money.  This is what the Alexa organization is all about.

I worked an entire year and I didn't even get a salary increase, none. Not even adjusted to inflation, it's really demoralizing and I am at a point where me and others are studying to interview with Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple.","Talk to your team about promotions before they get burntout and are right about to leave.  Too often I see people get promoted and then leave to another company 2 weeks later because you didn't offer I until they told you they got an offer from another company.  Pay your valued employees more, and if that is too difficult, at least have catered food for lunch.  I mean for the cost of like $10 a person in the office, people will give way more of that back during their lunch break at their desk or after they had lunch. If that is too expensive at least have healthier options in the kitchen.  Please show this to executive management to get more funding for this organization.  Alexa is a long term goal, don't take small gain short cuts.

Please show this to Rob Williams."

Be careful of Restricted Stock Units awarded as a % and not an exact number.,"Many of your employment contracts state for Restricted Stock Units “x% vest on the 15th of the month of your 1 year anniversary”. However, what you do not make apparent is that when the % inevitably includes partial shares, those shares round down. For example, if you are awarded 150 RSUs like I was, on year 1, your 5% vested amount is 7.5. This is then rounded down to 7 and then taxes, fees, and commissions are taken from that. I can imagine this has a bigger impact for those new hires who get a lower RSU allocation. For me, at the time of vesting, this 0.5 of a share was valued at $1,100 and was not a minor oversight. The feedback from HR was that “this is how it’s always been done”. There was nothing in the contract allowing for this, and thus my employment contract was breached. I am still working for Amazon, but can say I’m very unhappy with the way it was handled by HR and would expect better from such a large company with many lawyers. It became apparent to me that HR was more concerned about the implications of what correct this for me would be, as they have likely done this to many employees. 

MANAGEMENT: all your new hire contracts should state exact number of vesting shares, and not a percentage. 

NEW HIRES: require that your employment contract lists the exact number of vesting shares and not a %. This will avoid all surprises. I work in the Seattle office, so I can’t guarantee what employee contracts look like in other offices, but all potential new hires should be aware."

Do not fall for their “Same Day Hire” offers.""",Former Employee - Warehouse Worker,"Robbinsville, NJ",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I worked at Amazon part-time for less than a year,"Honestly, I’m not even sure if there is a pro. I guess that some of the people were nice at first? And it seemed easy to do. If you don’t have any physical problems, it should be a fine place to work.","I don’t know where to start. There is the lack of organization, the laziness to fix their problems, favoritism, and the ability to not work with their employees.

My main issue in the warehouse was they (or should I say their “random generator”) would put me in inbound and have me unload the trucks. Now, I have requested to maybe have me go else where to easier sections of the warehouse because I have rheumatoid arthritis and dermatomyositis (which I wasn’t exactly warned what this job entailed until I was actually started working there). But each time I requested, I got some excuse as to why I could not be accommodated- it’s a “random” system that places me there, I need to get papers signed by my doctor (which I get but it takes months to get an appointment where I go), or the “we can’t to anything about it because this is a physical job”. And I’m not stupid. I think I know by day 1 it’s a physical job. But I, a lack of muscle aching small person, was unloading trucks with the muscle men while the middle aged moms and other girls got less heavier things like small sort or sort slide. I never, if not rarely, was ever put into those sections.

Next, I’d like to point out the lack of training + throwing people all over the warehouse doing different jobs. I get it, moving people around makes it so it’s not boring. But put people in places where they were trained to work. We get new confused people in a different sections and then yelled at because everyone is going slow. Yeah, it’s because no one knows what they are doing or they have to fix what someone else messed up

Next, is communication with team members. I’ve been thrown back and forth between Safety and HR and both people have given me different responses to a problem and get mad at me for being confused. 

Then the organization of the ENTIRE company is a joke, you only get health benefits for working full time but they mostly hire part time, they don’t explain any of the rules and when you “break” a rule they rudely scold you, and to try and seem like a “good company” they get stupid stuff like a basket ball game set up in the work area (not the break room) or “treat” people to some food in the break room.  Or have “cool” prizes. Just stop. Help people with important things first like more pay or health coverage. Then you can go and play games. 

Also, I got the job in a separate state. Once I got a notification that a place was opening closer to me, I requested to be transferred or to maybe work on getting me to a closer location. But all I got was “well, you can quit here, do the whole process to get hired again, and reapply there.” Which it shouldn’t be hard to transfer a current employee.

Finally, I had enough and resigned. I thought I was done with amazon, but boy was I wrong. I still, to this day, get annoying spam messages and emails about VET opportunities or how I have unpaid time off used when I literally signed a sheet to resign my position, handed it to HR, and handed in my badge over a month ago. I do not work there anymore. I can’t even get in the building to complain. And I’ve messaged the company a couple days ago, no action was made. I can’t into the A to Z page to stop the messages. So I’m constantly reminded of the annoyance of ever being apart of amazon. 

I really tired to stay there. I tried to work things out with amazon, but they don’t care, they never cared, and they will never care about any of their employees. Not even the packages are cared for. Most of the employees throw the packages on the belts so “we can move faster” in the 3 hour shift they decided to have instead of the normal 4 hour shift. 

I’ve had a HORRIBLE experience working with amazon.","Get it together please and actually listen and help your employees. Also, if you don’t want people with disabilities (like myself) working there, actually tell us what the job description is instead of making everything sound nice and fun on your “same day hire” events. And stop pretending to care and actually care! Once I started working at amazon, I realized how fake everyone was when they said amazon was a fun, caring company to its employees."

The recruiters use a major bait and switch tactic, by enticing the applicants with the notion of corporate ""ownership."" That ownership gets packaged up in an offer of low pay, 4-year stock vestment, vacation that can't be taken right away (it has to accrue first), then presents the offer as a ""short term sacrifice,"" in order to entice the unaware into the most toxic and highest turnover work environment on the planet. With the average tenure at AWS of only 1 year, the applicant will never collect their stock due to lack of vestment time, turning the applicant's offer into one that is ""not worth the paper it's written on.""

What is really creates is a very toxic work environment, leaving the remaining staff to adopt a ""kill-or-be-killed"" culture, managed by leadership not interested in the people, but driven by that metrics. As a result of this ""Peculiar"" work environment, the #1 question asked by anyone who's been there long is, ""...am I on the DEV PLAN?,"" followed up with, ""are you Pivoting me out of the company?""

3994,"Nov 22, 2018","""Not the Same Company Jeff Bezos Describes""",Current Employee - Senior Finance Manager,"Seattle, WA",2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,I have been working at Amazon full-time for more than a year,"Amazon.com is a strong business fueled by a virtuous cycle. Sales growth drives increased network density which improves cost per package fueling more sales growth.  AWS is Amazon’s profit engine while growing rapidly and losing leadership to Azure.  Alexa is strong as well although also looking vulnerable to Google.  With growth comes opportunity.

The workforce is young and high energy.  You’ll find sharp folks in all organizations.  Decisions are made quickly especially when reversible.  Jeff is obsessed with delighting customers and long term in his thinking.  Peers tend to be sharp, but a step down from the other tech firms I’ve worked for.

Pay is fine- comparable to other top tech companies but lower after adjusting for cost of living.  Benefits are somewhat typical with the exception of vacation and sick days.  Both lag behind top tech peers.

The Seattle campus is beautiful and modern.  There are plenty of food choices including a good food truck scene.  The buildings are dog friendly which keeps things cheery.","I joined Amazon because I found that Jeff’s leadership principles and vision resonated with me.  I find those principles poorly lived at Amazon,  My impression is that the company grew too quickly and failed to maintain standards in doing so.  

For some context, I’ve worked in high tech since 2000 and have worked for three tech titans, all number one in their fields.  Amazon has lower standards than all three.  I’ve seen the worst tech of my career at Amazon.  I’ve seen the worst data, data management, and systems at Amazon.  The comparisons are quite stark.  Entire tech teams here would have been summarily fired at prior employers.  At Amazon, they linger despite low standards and repeated failures.

While Jeff is quite long term in focus, business unit heads can be very short term.  Emphasis is placed on the number of projects  completed in a given year.  (Congratulations on busy!). However, very little planning is done beyond the current year and next to nothing is discussed on long term vision.  Tech teams design to the current years’ projects which may not be aligned with the long term.  Much of the tech work is wasted year over year.

Rapid growth has led to a very inconsistent culture.  It’s unusual to work with anyone who has been at Amazon more than a couple of years. What is valued becomes subjective with little in the way of common standards for employee assessment.  Managers have nearly unilateral control over performance reviews which creates a culture of manager pleasing.  This leads to bad decisions as employees do not challenge their hierarchy.

Hubris is the Achilles heel of any successful company.  Amazon is no exception.  Folks expect newcomers to be awed.  I was, but not in a good way.  I find the company does little to study and adopt external best practices.  

The company practice of raising the bar with each external hire can mean you can find less capable folks at more senior grade levels.   Don’t expect your grade level to change as a result.  You can only be promoted within your current role.  If your boss is not interested in having you as a peer, you’ll have to take a lateral and then earn your promo there.

Some managers do consistently push their teams to their physical limits.  Health and marital problems are commonplace as a result. I’m the longest tenured team member at one year due to this.  The following three longest in seniority are all looking for other jobs.

Amazon doesn’t seem to see high turnover as wasteful.  Nothing seems to be done with managers who have 100% turnover every year.  

Low standards leave little to learn from. If you’re driven by intellectual curiosity and personal growth, you may need to look elsewhere.","There are far too many managers that are not capable of getting into the detail of the work (diving deep).  When a manager can’t understand the work being done, they hinder as often as they help.  They struggle to discern good work from bad and often exhibit poor judgment as they lack context.

Amazon should consider collecting feedback from employees on how well their manager understands their work.  A good barometer is whether employees indicate the manager could perform the role if needed.  Managers with a high ratio of “no’s” should be under scrutiny.  Amazon should consider moving them to roles that align with their strengths.

Amazon should ask employees which leadership principles their teams exemplify and which they struggle with.  They should ask the same questions to employees of their managers.  Teams should also be graded by partner groups.  

Managers should be assessed on how much they can teach or help their employees.   A manager who cannot help their employees grow can do little to help Amazon’s growth."

From day 1, I owned my own matters, made independent decisions, and worked frontline with new clients and customers.  It's a lot more responsibility than my law firm associate role, and has more opportunities to speak up and lead.  The issues we work through might be operationally difficult, involve high dollar value transactions, or have customer-facing implications (or all three) but each attorney works independently and within the team to solve them.

I get excellent mentorship and training benefits.  There are more levels between you and leadership than at a firm, but there are also good opportunities to work with senior leaders on specific deals, project work (for process improvement, scaling etc), and as an escalation point.  My career got a big jump start by being at Amazon, and my manager is actively coaching me to achieve my goals.  I feel that Amazon has invested in me, and that makes me more willing to invest in Amazon.

Everyone I work with is super smart and has high expectations.  They all went to excellent law schools, and worked at top tier law firms and in house roles before joining Amazon.  You get to work with, and be trained by, the best here.

The leadership principles are very real - your hiring, performance, and promotion, are all tracked against them.  Team members and leaders give feedback framed in the leadership principles, and it creates a common language in a huge company, which I've found helpful.","I generally work law firm hours still.  Some weeks are better than others, but this isn't a normal in house role.

I expect that almost every possible type of job can be found here; if it isn't, it could be created. At Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I work, you would be hard-pressed to find more interesting, challenging, and future-thinking technology. One of my favorite things about working at Amazon in general is the inclusion--Amazon proudly employs, and vocally supports, minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals (including transgender persons), veterans, and people with disabilities. My entire management hierarchy, including myself, is made up of women (until reaching the CEO, Andy Jassy, who is male). As a young employee, I feel like my opinions are valued, and that I'm not looked down on due to my age or tenure. If you're hard-working, tenacious, and incredulous, you can find a place at Amazon.","Amazon is an extremely fast-moving workplace, which is exciting, but it can also be exhausting if you don't know how to manage the pace. It is critical to set a work/life balance for yourself (or as Jeff Bezos says, work/life harmony). Management also plays a huge part in how much people enjoy working at Amazon. I have heard of people having night and day experiences on two similar teams, or even the same team, due to a change in management. The process to be promoted can also extremely vary across organizations, and there is a lack of inconsistency in who is promoted, after what time period. You need to be an advocate for yourself when you work at Amazon (but I've found many mentors who helped me grow this skill, personally and professionally, during my time here).",

Repetitive task oriented work
Easy if you pay attention","•Supervisors/ambassadors (young, inexperienced in management, condescending, argumentative)
•Scheduling-hard to get a good schedule if you start seasonally
•Differentiating training on daily tasks regardless of how the full group is instructed by upper management.
•cut hours frequently 
•poor training if trained at all","***I’m working PT as a second income and I have management and HR experience. I’m going to be as objective as Possible but this is also based on my experience at one warehouse, others could be run differently.***

Be aware of your team and train your ambassadors so they are able to properly train the team to do things consistently, accurately and with minimal downtime. Be mindful of unproductive people and address the issues. I’m in a warehouse that ships around 30,000 packages a night but if people were trained when hired and things were done productively, it could be accomplished with a third less staff in the same time. There’s 2 hours minimum on-boarding training videos you have to do before you start (Unpaid) that could EASILY include training on how to pick, pack, stow and load a van so people could be ready on day one and already know the basics. That is, if they didn’t give a completely different training on how to do things based on who’s there. (Very frustrating for someone who’s been a trainer). They could EASILY create an interactive training course on familiarizing yourself with how to read the labels etc, the post office does this before you’re even hired to be sure you understand what you’ll need to be able to do. Be mindful that “ambassador” is a supervisory role, and should be earned by people who are at minimum knowledgeable and experienced in the work and managing people. 

All that being said, having an HR background I’ve seen enough to qualify for a hostile work environment case before I hit a month in. (Again, this is one location) Some management figures can be great and some seem to be too immature for the position (argumentative, bad mouthing corporate on day 1, unwilling to conform to upper management training procedures). Others have a lot of unnecessary back and forth with employees ultimately running them off for no reason. 

Overall it’s an “easy” job (you can work up a sweat) that pays good money for what it is. Just block out the nonsense and get your work done. I gave it 3 stars because of the pay and benefits and ease of the job, it’s the same everyday. But those 2 stars down are based on management and lack of proper training."

You are able to use unpaid time off at your discretion. Training was from home and you work from home. They provide the equipment,  laptop and headphones.  The hours are mediocre.","When you apply you think you will be working 29 to 31 hours a week, right? Wrong.  You are trained to assist with helping drivers on the road. They may need a package scanned or assistance locating a customer. No problem. Then they say you will be taking a few customer calls. Haha. That is reversed. 
You will get 98% of customer calls and 2% off driver calls. Every customer thinks they are entitled to complain about having and paying for prime to have 2 day shipping. I guess someone left out that they are paying for other stuff too like prime video, music, free books monthly, etc. They need to get off their high horses and get real. The first schedule they give you those hours I guess so that you can get acclimated and settled in. Then the schedule after the initial schedule the hours are increased. From 29-31 hours a week to 32-35, and up to 37-39hours. Working all these hours would qualify me for full time but according to amazon since we are part time flex they have the right to have you work all those hours according to the business needs. My needs were for part time hours not full time. I haven't even had much time to spend with my family which was the reason for me getting the job in the first place. So BEWARE! On the other hand some agents loved the increased hours.  Just an FYI. Also they will add mandatory over time to your schedule if not enough agents have signed up. I don't know about you guys but I like to be able to choose if I want to work more, and also see if I can fit it into my schedule. Amazon's customers are always angry. Why? Because they didn't get their packages in 2 days. Amazon needs to figure a way for the shipping and delivery team to gain more insight as to what happened to packages because we are pretty much telling the customer what the retail agent told them after they are transferred over to us. Like we have so much more info to give. Crazy. The flex drivers should pay more attention to where they are delivering because that's the cause of most issues. They should be trained better. We are the ones that get the brute off their misdeliveries.","Omg, half of supervisors were decent. Some just had a bad attitude.

Amazon warehouse has an open door employment. Anyone can just get a job in the Amazon warehouse as long as they pass the drug test - which everyone takes at the orientation.  

There are certain shift assistants who don't have great people skills, that makes working FOR them unbearable. 

It's micro-managed to a tee, so be prepare to be herded to your next destination every 10 minutes or so. 

When they assigned tasks, it's usually influenced by favoritism. 

There are some task that are easier than others, such as scanning for packages -you're sitting down the whole time, and associates who usually get this task for the shift are usually favored by the shift assistant. 

This type of management and operational style makes you want to quit, which they won't care, since Amazon's HR is flooding them with new employees every month, anyway.

If you choose not to seek out new opportunities, it's rare for someone to come find you for them.","Amazon's rating system is designed to identify top and bottom performers. Top performers are rewarded, bottom performers are coached and developed, but the middle is often omitted, and not given enough coaching to become a top performer in some cases. Management should look for new ways to develop the steady middle of the road performers. Also, look to promote more from within, vs. hire from the outside.

The co-workers are good.,There is no adherence to safety.  Most people complain about political correctness I had to tell people not to tell me about their personal lives.,"UPDATE: Three days after this email was sent to HR,  I was let go from a seasonal position at Amazon. So I decided to go public. I am sure there is going to be some mud slinging but I am not going to let anyone get hurt. On the other hand, it might make them clarify their position so that the people at BF7 or Sumner, WA are safe.

Please read it all before making a comment
To whom it may concern;

There are a few safety concerns here at Amazon that I feel should be addressed before someone is injured.

1) Mech lifts (100 pounds or more) are being performed by one person in order to make rates (even with a tip and slide when the package is on the floor the slammers still have to lift it enough to put it on their pallet.)
When an employee asks for help they are made to feel like they are bothering someone.

2) Team lifts are completely ignored. If the employee is expected to lift a package on their own it should be stated ahead of your hiring practice so someone can decide not to work at a bulk facility.

3) Stop signs on the floor are faded and starting to come apart. They need to be replaced. The Stowers also like to park items on top of them.

4) Your rates for pickers are too high and unsafe. If they ask for help every time they follow the supposed safety rules they would not make rates.

5) Your Stowers are building pallets too high and they are causing near misses.

6) The stats should not be a moving target. Managers telling employees that they are expected to double their rates from 24 to 40 or 50 is dangerous and promotes bad habits.

7) Leaving one person to work the floor while all the other employees are in standup across the building is unsafe and will delay emergency response times.

8) When employees ask about company policies the management says they don't know the answer.

9) Trainers are contradicting their safety standards. I was told by one trainer that you could not extend your forks and drive forward while picking. Another trainer said you could. Pickers are pulling out of a pallet and moving to their next pick with the forks on H level and lowering it as they drive through the warehouse.

10) The product is being stacked so high in the bulk area that they are starting to compress and lean in such a manner that it is unsafe to be around them and in some cases pick them.

11) Pickers are expected to climb into bins to pull an order. The product is forced into bins causing pickers to have to pull everything in it in order to find the right order.

12) Competition is good but trash talking other shifts and individual employees is unprofessional and demeaning. When done by associates it can be bad however when it is done by the people in charge it is unacceptable. It encourages unsafe competition and retaliation.

We need to know that safety standards are real and not just lip service."

I personally have not experienced any of that nor have I seen or heard anything either, I’m sure that there are good and bad teams or managers, but I have not seen it. 

What I have seen is that everyone here is really smart and wants you to succeed in your role and as a company overall. AWS provides the tools and training to help you become successful. It is up to you to apply what you learn and already know to solve the problems discovered in talking with the Customer. 

The collaboration individually as well as part of a team is like nothing I’ve experienced. People genuinely want to help each other out and focus on the Customer, their issues we are working (backwards) to solve.

In today’s world, we always hear about how important the Customer is, but at AWS  it occurs every day and is not just some marketing tag line. Sitting in a meeting with CxO’s and hearing first hand how truly focused we are on them (the Customer) really instills trust and a long-term relationship. To me working here is AWSome and everyday I come into work ready to take on the next challenge.

If you are looking for a company where you are challenged daily and love to learn, then you will not go wrong in accepting a role with AWS. There is literally unlimited opportunities to learn, grow and take on new responsibilities.

You are the only limitation in where you want to grow and become AWSome.","No cons, thus so far - honestly. While it is true that there are most likely challenging managers and roles, I’d rather be challenged intellectually and know that what I am doing is solving complex problems than sitting at my desk bored wondering what’s for lunch. (not a Con)

Getting into AWS is very challenging and demands high quality work once you are hired. It doesn’t end after you are hired, it only starts… (not a Con)

Is it hard to work for AWS? Yes, that is why I wanted to come work here. (not a Con)

Is it rewarding? Of course.

(The company has not learned.) More broadly, people there are so busy and so low on EQ, it is not a pleasant place to work. 

The work is mind numbingly abusive. The caliber of projects I was given were on the level of things I did 5 or 10 years ago, and the volume of work was 2-3x what is reasonable if you don't want someone to work until 11pm every night. If you have any level of senior management experience, do not expect to develop and evolve your skill set; expect to be taken advantage of via over-work on basic projects.

They don't offer any management training or understand what good mid-level management looks like. Whether you want to develop as a manager or be managed well, odds are stacked against you. I've never seen so many bad managers in one company. 

Beware the smoke and mirrors. There is an extraordinary PR narrative around the company due to it's stock price and Bezos' wealth. Behind the curtain, the company is not as good at data as it pretends to be, and their ""customer obsession"" is a thinly veiled metaphor for profit-seeking. (They do not understand or value real customer insights nor do they have they evolved much beyond their 1990's playbook of how personalization should work.) All the innovation is also top-down, often from people who have been at Amazon so long, they are out of touch. It's uninspiring.

1. The thing most Amazonians I know like the most is the Ownership culture. Individual contributors are authorized, expected and encouraged to come up with ideas, launch them and see them through to the end. Ownership is a way to disperse decision making authority downwards so that decisions can be made much faster not as a way for managers to cover themselves for mistakes made.
2. Along with the Ownership culture, Amazonians are given the opportunity to define their roles and activities to a remarkable extent. Of course every team is different but my experience is that at least towards the senior levels of the SA community individuals have the ability to act with a lot of autonomy making choices on what to focus on and how to achieve their goals.
3. Change is a constant. Within AWS, the market and field of cloud computing is growing and changing so fast that there is always a new challenge to take on. Successful Amazonians tend to be people who like to tackle challenges and then move on to new ones.","Two of the common complaints I've heard in my time at AWS:
1. The downside of the Ownership culture is that people who don't thrive in somewhat ambiguous environments can find it hard to find their footing. Management at AWS is a little different than it is in other places and some employees may feel that they aren't getting the direction they are used to.
2. The pace of the environment is fast and can be overwhelming to new employees. The field of Enterprise Cloud Computing is fairly new and the platform is expanding at an amazing rate which drives constant change. If you aren't the kind of person who can adapt and learn quickly it can be a tough environment to thrive in.",

I get to work with some of the smartest and innovative people on the planet. Amazon has made me better in everything I do. I came to Amazon looking for an opportunity to stretch and that has happened in every way. As an HR professional, I have to be open and objective. But, Amazon has stretched those skills, too. No problem or idea  is too big or too small at Amazon. We're encouraged to think of better and more efficient ways to do everything. Nothing is off limits. Amazon is an environment for people who want to work hard and who want to do their best. I've had the chance to do that here. 

Some describe Amazon's environment as tough and work hours intensive. I would challenge that and describe Amazon as an honest environment with open and frequent feedback. The number of hours you work at Amazon can be intense, but we play hard, too. I also think the number of hours we work is sometimes self imposed. When my friends and family ask me about whether or not Amazon would be a good fit for them, I balance my answer by what I know about them and not Amazon. If I know them to be hard workers with high standards and someone who consistently stretches themselves (raises the bar), I tell them they should come to Amazon tomorrow. If, however, I know them to like do things the easy way or to settle for ""okay"" in the things they do, I tell them that Amazon may not be a good fit for them.","Amazon is a large place and it's easy to get lost. You'll have to actively work to get to know people outside of your team. Amazon has a lot of Connections groups to help with this, but you have to make the time to do it. Amazon's Seattle location leaves a lot to be desired where diversity in ethnicity is concerned. The Seattle area has a very small population of people of color. So, living in the area can be a bit isolating. 

The cost of living in Seattle can also be a shock. Be sure to do your research. 

Amazon, and other large companies in the area, don't seem to be doing enough to help with the homeless population in Seattle. This responsibility probably shouldn't fall to private companies, but their growth is what drives the cost of living, which drives homelessness. The homeless population also affects Amazon employees who aren't from areas with large homeless populations. I've been here for almost 4 years and I'm still uncomfortable with the tent camps, solicitation in the downtown area, and the fact that people are in need.","My only advice is around the compensation model for a weird reason. Our shares have outperformed what any of us could have guessed. This leads to employees not getting increases because their share value has doubled or quadrupled. This is the toughest thing to explain to employees who are doing a wonderful job. 

It's a good problem to have, but employees don't always get it and still want more even when they are earning way more than originally planned."

Good place for older adults to finish their working careers if all they truly need is benefits. Young aggressive adults will be promoted. Benefits are good. Time off is generous. 10 hour 4 day work week is a benefit to most employees. Amazon offers to pay for college and technical training. Coaching for resumes and interviews. Starting wages are fair and there are quick raises. Many other internal benefits such as training in new departments or processes and training in PIT (Powered Industrial Trucks).  Associates, for the most part, are friendly to each other. Bathrooms are clean.  Generally the Operations Manager holds an all hands meeting once a month and they generally do a good job engaging the employees. Peak times Amazon tries to create an atmosphere of fun and games. They also raffle off many great prizes during Peak times. Amazon has a very good program offering company stocks to full time employees. Each year around February, Amazon offers employees to quit with a severance pay that pays into the thousands depending on the number of ""peaks"" you successfully worked through.","Older adults, for the most part will not be promoted because management is usually young and they tend to overlook the value of experienced employees.
Many tier one associates will be trained on the Kiva floor where they are expected to work in a dangerous environment without the benefit of extra pay. Long distances in these large warehouses means you have to move fast to get to break rooms  for 15 minute breaks where most breaks will last you only 7 to 8 minutes.","Management needs to engage their employees more  at their stations.  This will help the managers to know what employees are thinking. Help employees become better performers without constant threats.  Promote older workers who want to be promoted if they meet standards for promotion. After a year, Process Assistance or PA's should be moved to other departments for several reasons. Two reasons are (1) they learn  the processes  of the warehouse and then they become promotable if they meet the standards for promotion to Area Manager (AM). (2) Most PA's will have there favorites and those favorite employees  will get the most new training in other processes  and promotions due to the PA's recommendations.

Free stock given to you upon a 2 year commitment to the company. Random prizes given out for trivia, games, or just coming in to work (I've won 5 prizes so far, things from a $5 gift card up to a $79 kindle)  
      As far as the labor goes, most of the physical labor jobs in the facility I work in (Florence NJ) are extremely easy to learn. Some of them are more physical than others, but you do get rotated out of a physical job at the end of the lunch hour, so your body isn't going through the same stress motions all day long.  
 You get two (2) fifteen minute (15) breaks((which are NOT mandatory by law in New Jersey unless you are under the age of 17 )) Our facility also offers FREE shuttle service to the riverline train transport in the area for associates. 
You are give Paid Time Off (P.T.O.) for 48 hours a year, and Unpaid Time Off (U.P.T.) for 80 hours a year, plus the UPT reloads 20 hours every quarter of the year.  On top of all that, you ALSO get PAID vacation which accrues ever other paycheck. 
I believe there is a Maternity Leave that puts a Mother paid to be out for at least 2 month if not more, and a Paternity leave that is about 2 months paid as well. 
Amazon also offers 95% tuition paid if you choose to follow in one of five fields of study in certain college courses.  Associates are also given free resume, interviewing, computer (excel, microsoft word and others) classes throughout the year if they apply for them in the building and the classes  aren't full. 
There are also pay raises for new hires every 6 months, until you get to your third year, then you top out. However, there are seasonal promotions and regular promotions available randomly throughout the year.","Some employees are the biggest con I go to right away. You will come up face to face with quite a few people who just don't want to work at all. This means ANY physical labor is ""excessive"" in their eyes. I watch people in and out all day long perform Time Off Task (T.O.T.) mostly people just wander around talking to friends they made while working here, or family that works here as well. I don't mean just dropping by to say hi and leaving. I'm talking about people taking 3-20 minute blocks of just not working because there isn't a Process Assistant or Area Manager around to catch them. 
That is my biggest problem with this place. It's not an Amazon problem per say, I would imagine any warehouse would have this issue of ""when the cat's away, the mice will play"" going on. Just here, the people seem coddled to be honest. 
Other than that, the physical labor (to be expected) will have you sore the first few weeks especially if you came from a job that didn't require you to be on your feet for 10 hours at a time, lifting boxes or totes most of the day (if you land that job that day)
The parking lot is the other negative (which isn't Amazon's fault). The township's fire marshal wouldn't authorize a second entrance/exit for cars, so everyone on that shift has to wait a solid 30mins to an hour to get out during ""Peak (early November - mid/late December) Note that during non peak times, it's usually a 5-10 minute wait tops before it's clear driving right out.","I would recommend a position that just follows people around (from a distance)  in each department, and monitors T.O.T.  much closer.
