In other words, there is NO shortage of cool stuff to do besides your day to day (which time you can manage on your own anyway).

Don't get me wrong that's great that we're doing all those things for our communities, but I get the feeling that the ratio is too much towards that and I miss those communications about what's exciting in our business. one example: for every two or three posts about executives building houses or helping the  homeless, I'd like to see a post of them having fun and trying to guess how much a DNA Center appliance weighs for example, or showcasing the new Meraki camera vision intelligence, or talking about the markets and stuff like that.",Cisco

That went away as soon as the downturn started, and then the layoffs began shortly thereafter. The first couple of years they laid off the bad people, and then there weren't any bad people left, so they just started flailing the axe at random. Every year around late summer, it swings again, so everyone is just sitting in dread waiting to see who goes. Then, afterwards, you have to try to figure out how to get things done when important pieces of your team aren't there anymore.

Good work/life balance. ""Family first"" approach. Diverse workforce. Many opportunities to attend training and conferences. Worked there for 9 years and was promoted 3 times with 2 raises outside promotions.","Engineering management varies widely between locations. My first 7 years were with a business unit where I had a great experience and was appreciated and promoted several times. Management was supportive and seemed truly invested in my career development and work/life balance. Development was team oriented with lots of collaboration and support from peers. 

Then I made an unfortunate lateral move to another business unit in another city with some major issues I did not anticipate. Engineering staff there had serious morale issues. My peers were constantly ""joking"" about how terrible the product we were all working on was. At first I wondered why nobody did anything to just fix the issues. After working there a while I realized it was because the engineers have practically zero ability to effect change in the product. So the senior engineers there are basically just going through the motions because the pay is pretty good, the benefits are basically second to none, and they don't want to lose that. Meanwhile the younger engineers are leaving because the environment is pretty awful. 

Having your own hard-wall office seems great at first until you realize you hardly ever collaborate with the people on your team. On my project the standard practice was to assign a single engineer to develop a feature, write tests, and perform QA in practical isolation. As you can imagine this was pretty stressful and didn't work very well, resulting in buggy products due to lack of a dedicated QA team. Asking for help on an engineering issue was usually like pulling teeth because you had to pull other engineers away from their work to collaborate. Management was not receptive of suggestions to change the status quo to alleviate these issues. My manager frequently missed our weekly one-on-one meetings, sometimes for several weeks in a row. When I attempted to reschedule these missed meetings my requests were frequently ignored. I know of at least 5 other engineers that left the org within a few months of when I did due to the increasingly toxic environment.","Let go of the status quo that is clearly not working. Reassign or let go of the engineering managers that can't cope with change and are clearly not effective engineering managers. Adopt a collaborative, team based model where employees support each other and feel included instead of isolated. Address the product issues that engineers bring forward.

There’s ways to get involved to navigate the vastness, for example tuning into our company all hands meeting, also known as the Cisco Beat. This is an opportunity to hear firsthand our leadership’s top of mind and where Cisco is focused as a company. Another way to get involved is by joining an Employee Resource Organization (ERO), such as Early Career Network or Connected Women. These employee organizations are communities that help you grow personally and professionally by connecting you with others who share similar interests and come from similar backgrounds. It is a chance to experience the wonderful diversity that exists within Cisco . Lastly, the flexibility that Cisco has is unmatched.

The compensation is outrageously good.
If you are a survivor you will do well here.
If you are a high performer, you will do financially well here.
If you slack, you may actually do better than the high performers as management keeps the slackers around to cut them every 6 months when LRs are mandated.
When you are impacted by an LR and you will be, you earn a great exit package (I earned one year of base pay for 4 years of work...)
The DCP is pretty cool for 13/89s, but on reflection, if I knew Cisco was such an unstable company, I'd not had invested in the DCP program as now all my DCP is paid in one big chunk in one year instead of spread over several years as I had planned.  Live and learn :)","Cisco's definition of culture in my brief 4-year stint was ""everything is about money"".   That is good and bad - good because you can make some serious dough here, bad because there is no sense of community in the workforce.

Cisco has limited restructurings in spring and fall.  The lifers refer to avoiding a layoff as ""being safe"" which is in my mind an oxymoron.  There is no such thing as safety at Cisco.  If you come here, be prepared to move on when you hit the wrong set of cost lists.  High performance is no guarantee of ""safety"" either; I earned 1.3x-1.5x multipliers on my bonuses every year for 4 years - still impacted by an LR.  Most restructuring affects older (highly compensated) workers.  There is no other logical conclusion to the restructurings than they are meant to cut already well-trained long-term growth employees and replace them with a younger untrained workforce.  These LRs create intense stop energy in the company nearly all the time as everyone is in a state of panic.  This ""Fog of War"" is difficult for innovators to execute in making Cisco pivot like an Exxon Valdez rather than an Eagle.

Cisco completely doesn't understand open source and evidenced by the latest round of LRs in 2018 that impacted nearly every engineer doing any sort of open source work.  The engineering workforce is far too compliant resulting in high degrees of passive-aggressive behavior rather than assertiveness.","Rethink your tactics on restructuring efficiency.  I know the bean counters ""think"" its cheaper to cut headcount and pay restructuring charges then to move people around in the company.  The reality is you constantly are churning your excellent staff and creating lifetime enemies in the industry in the process.

Pro Tip: Open Source is table stakes in today's business environment.  If you see it as a donation rather than influence, do you also see your job as an executive donation, rather than influence?  One of the many purposes of open source is to influence business outcomes in a positive way.  Just like you do in your day job as an executive.  I don't understand why this is so difficult for Cisco executives to grasp.

Cisco's products are made up of 50-90% of open source components.  It was always embarrassing to me that Cisco had such a high rate of consumption of open source, yet such a low rate of influence as a result of under-investment.

I have worked at many different companies including start-ups and other mature companies. I will be at Cisco until I retire. Cisco does an outstanding job at giving employees the freedom to deliver to their full potential and rewards excellence. Many companies claim to encourage upward mobility but never deliver. Cisco has an incredible amount of opportunity and every leader I have encountered at Cisco actively encourages her or his team member to prepare for the next role. Additionally, There are many avenues to share your ideas and execute on them if they make sense.

It is humbling to ask a question and immediately be in touch with someone who authored the book on a subject!

Full Time means much less of the 9-5 hourly requirements that contractors have and a job based on deliverables and owning your time.  By that I mean I have flexibility to set my schedule to make child drop off, personal time and other scheduling things without managers approval as long as I am staying on task.
The ability to access the huge amount of Cisco and 3rd party training for free as an employee has been a major bonus.  The yearly benefits like health/dental/vision, matching 401k and stock program are of high value.  If you work at the larger offices (San Jose or RTP) the onsite amenities (cafe, gym, medical, etc) are top notch.
Salary can vary widely, but I feel they are consistent with tech companies in the area.  The annual bonus is split into 50% in the Spring and 50% in the Fall.  Bonus is dependent on Company and personal performance.  Employees are encourages to give each other recognition from $25-$500 in the form of a gift card for a job well done.

I do value the way we treat customers and follow up to solve problems.  We do the right thing and I would not be here if that was not the case.

-you can give feedback easily to your manager 
-The pay is good","1-Extremely stressful env EVERYthing revolves around quota and sales even if you are not in sales teams.  but if you are not getting your Quota while you are not sales function it will impact your performance and your bonus. 

2-In my interview i was asked if i ever worked with quota and I said no but when i started my job I found out that they added quota on me and its noncommissionble and must bring it each quarter. i disagreed and then I said if I work on quota then I need my commission.. Managers did not agree and I had a conflict with them.

3- The company has VERY high turnover from employees and contractors. its not easy to deal with too many changes per day and week and month.

4- They keep acquiring companies and its tough to focus on your role since every other quarter there is a new re-org and new policies. 

5-The work pace is TOOOO FAST and the company has TOOOO MANY  customer accounts and they expect you to over perform and do your 150%. All the team members and your other colleagues are  not easy to meet and talk with them. Every thing is Webex and ALl the workers are overloaded with work.

6- Its nice to have many Tools to help you do your work like webex  etc BUT  its overused with all the teams. for example if you ask any question about anything they team member will answer you with list of ALL the webex recordings and links by the time you want to watch them and understand the answer that is like a week worth of things and the team member thinks he did the write think for you but really he gave you Major new work. 

7- Too many trainings, by the team you do your internal meeting (physical or webes), then you calls, then your huge list of links and webex recordings its really tough to achieve during your day since all these things take your time and you may have time later on the day to do some of your work.

8- There are SO many feedbacks on you during the week and after each sessions etc etc you need to be always connected with the team and it feels that you ONLY live for Cisco there is nothing else to do in this life. 

9-I have never seen a company that asks their sales team commitment calls to be WEEKLY. So the sales team are  in MAJOR stress and they stress the other teams with them. 

10- Unless you like that type of  env and CONTINUES work , then I don't recommend that company for people with Family and kids and social life.  I noticed most  people working very long hours from 8am until OPEN. 

11- Cisco has many products (old, new, acquired, etc) and once you join,   they will buy new company and then new products. Most of these products work in theory but in real life and at customer site its REALLY complicated and tough and they may work but with a lot of difficulties and many Cisco internal teams involvements. its Tough technical env.  with all these complications. 

12-  Cisco  were a hardware company and trying to switch to software company and that is difficult and too many challenges especially they don't have the software company mindset.","-Management Must listen to employees, especially the ones who may come from NON-Cisco env.

Other people say Cisco has good work life balance. I think it depends on what product you are working on. I feel like I am under a lot of stress generally and put in a lot of hours. I have been at Cisco over 10 years and there haven't been a lot of breaks. 

Many of my coworkers work from home at least a couple days a week, especially after they moved us to an open floor plan.

The people I work with are for the most part friendly, smart and professional.

I love making killer products that make billions of dollars of revenue each year.

I learn new things constantly and feel challenged.","At least in engineering, there is not a supportive environment for women. There is lack of education among the first line managers how to promote respect and give air time to all type of people, and to promote, give opportunities, listen to and value the ideas of  women. And there is some blatant sexism. For example, when I had my baby, my manager told me the 'right' thing to do was to become a stay at home mom. And despite  making a sacrificial effort to perform well my first year with a baby, my manager said he gave me an average rating because I had a baby. His perception was colored by my being  a mother. I thought I deserved a higher rating for an exceptional year. And he asked me what are my priorities, my child or my job? He didn't ask my male coworkers this question. Even now, he 'forgets' to give me a bonus even though he gave every other report of his one (who are all male). In the previous two layoffs, the only persons he laid off were women. He asks me to plan the fun group outings, not my male colleagues. On separate occasions, my director and my VP asked me to take minutes when there were plenty of men available to also take minutes. Many of my female coworkers moved on because of the frustration of not having their opinions valued as much as our male coworkers. It's a tough problem to solve because people come to Cisco from many types of backgrounds, but I feel there is no management support from any level of the management chain except for Chuck and his direct reports. 

Open space floorplan is distracting visually and audially. The space is so tight that the moveable whiteboards are not near our desks.

Currently, morale is a little down because it is not clear how individuals will be engaged in making the future roadmap happen. People fear for their jobs. We've had repeated layoffs in my group, and there will be more to come.","Work on retaining women in engineering, not just hiring new college grads.

Cisco in general is an amazing company to work for and our leaders are just that; intelligent, committed, individuals who strive to ensure our success.

Customer Success is the new era of sales and I would highly reccomend this position. This role is unique in how it exposes you to the new way of not just selling products, but selling business outcomes. It's also exciting for those who like to innovate, value relationship-building with the customer, and pioneer new processes and ideas. I really enjoy being able to have direct impact at a company this big and being a member of the Customer Success Team here at Cisco gives you that unique opportunity. 

I can't emphasize enough the responsiveness of our executives and leaders; I'm honestly amazed at how Cisco has given new employees the ability to have exposure with our senior management and how willing and compasionate they are about our sales team.

I would reccomend Cisco, Customer Success, and Sales to anyone, hands down.","Working at a fortune 100 company as large as Cisco, especially as we migrate our revenue model and product offerings, means there will be holes. I think this is natural at any large company but the mindset of adapting to ever-changing processes, acquisitions, etc. is crucial in order to thrive. Not necessarily a con if you like a challenge and put in a lot of effort. 

No ""work from home"" but not necessarily a con either; I personally prefer to come in the office but just something to keep in mind as people have different views on this.","Stay engaged with your team members and keep developing talent; leadership and management does a great job of doing this. 

Minor constructive criticism from personal perspective: I think it's important for our leaders (and fellow Customer Success Managers/Sales counterparts) to keep in mind that we are experienced sellers even though we are ""CSAP"". CSAP traditionally has been an ASR training program for individuals straight from college and it sometimes feels as if people forget that we are 25-35 year olds; the vibes come off the wrong way occasionally. This could be due to the fact that this is the first year this role was launched but awareness is key. Super minor but that would be my only advice.",Cisco

Child out with serious illness, again most groups really pitch in to help out.
Long term, short term disability outside California is not as good as CA, but better than most companies in RTP. Parental leave meets local laws, but not equel throughout company.
IC's allowed to make deisions
PTO at 4 wks starting can't be beat.","Cisco is very risk adverse for long term projects. Some are ahead of their time, but company not willing to develop market or save product for when market is available.
New products only seem to build on existing. Market share loss to cloud vendors, etc. New Security services along with Advanced Sere vices pulling in most of money
Work loads can vary by groups.  Yearly layoffs becoming a thing.  Seems that it's quicker and less expensive to lay off top technical people and hire new ones with some new expertise, rather that really invest in and develop current dedicated staff.
Mobile worker cubes and open work environments not conducive to burying your head into work.
I'm sure there are far worse places to work in North Carolina","PLEASE change risk attitudes from the top down, please! Take the big risks- ones that may take several years to pan out- just like Google, Amazon, GE, Tesla, Microsoft. 
Please stop being afraid of leaving core competencies. Use your world-class engineering staff to dream, and dream big. Develop products that rival the success Cisco IP Phones, CCM, and Unified Communications, capitalize on it, and promote the company brand with the public again, so that they notice the Cisco phones in Petsmart and Home Depot.
 
Finally, the mobile worker cubes don't actually help morale or productivity for core Engineering staff. Most of us couldn't hear ourselves think.  Engineer staff need to collaborate, but at the same time need a dedicated location (not at home) to think, plan, and code. I had difficult time staying focused, plus no room for my Webster's dictionary, Thesaurus, Marketing and Technical Doc Style guides.",Cisco

Its flagship products (router/switches) are powered by an OS written in the early 90s. The groups that work on these products are typically 10 years behind the rest of the industry, and are so large that the rest of the company is held back by them. 

Management has been aware of this for years, and so has been acquiring other companies to do the development work that its core engineering groups are simply incapable of doing. This makes the company a bit schizophrenic as there is no real coordinated effort to move the company in a specific direction.

This is not a condition unique to Cisco; Microsoft famously has similar problems with Windows. It does not make the company a bad one, but it's certainly not as forward looking as you might think.

Over the last 18 months there has been major changes in Cisco as a whole.  Some of this change is for the good.  Especially our moving to more of a licensing model.  The main issue is that goals have shot through the roof and the culture has been hit drastically.  

Prior to these changes we had the freedom to work in an atmosphere that promoted and strong work/life balance and a culture that was second to none.  Our team was one of the most successful in all of Cisco and you could not find a person on our team that was unhappy with the culture/environment.  Now it's hard to find someone that wouldn't jump ship if the opportunity presented itself.  

As for goals, the first few years of my tenure with Cisco our uplifts year over year ranged from 12% - 20% which, dependent on territory, gave everyone the opportunity to be successful.  My personal goals for the last couple years have exceeded 50% year over year growth and I know of teammates who's goals have exceeded 80%.   When your OTE (On Target Earnings) are based on a 50/50 salary to commission structure, this kills your income.  My understanding is one person on our entire team of 25 that is on target to hit goals this year.","Cisco for years has promoted publicly the concept of Changing the Way We Live, Work, Play and Learn.   The concept of being able to have a work life balance and how this was a priority shared by Cisco.  To have the opportunity to be productive from anywhere at anytime.  The idea of trusting it's employees to work from home or anywhere for that matter.  And in return the employees trusting Cisco to make decisions that were in the best interest of the company and themselves.

+ They do not skimp on developer machines and peripherals like monitors, headphones, etc.","- Very bureaucratic, lots of reorgs and movement at the middle and upper levels (e.g. new directors, mid-level managers, upper-level managers).

- The pay is below average in comparison to other tech companies in the Bay Area. Promotions/raises seem to be few and far between. It will soon be my third year here, and all of my developer peers have also complained about slow growth within the company.

- Due to the bureaucratic nature of the company, communication among the many groups is slow and sporadic.

- It may be different for other groups, but there seems to be a general lack of expertise when it comes to software development best practices:
-- Everything is hacked together
-- Quantity of features and speed of development > quality and stability
-- There are no design/architecture discussions that include all of the developers (""design"" of the product usually happens as informal conversations between mid-to-senior level developers, without including the newer/entry-level developers). These discussions are ad-hoc, informal, and often not even documented.
-- No standards followed for releases/deployment
-- Very little effort spent on documentation of anything
-- We are one of the many groups that tries to follow Agile/Scrum, but since we don't follow a lot technical practices that actual make Agile work (e.g. unit tests, code reviews, decent documentation, reasonably-sized & well-defined user stories, etc.), it isn't working as it should. The end result is shoddy code and constantly accumulating technical debt.

- People in non-technical roles (middle managers and product owners) push for features and user stories without really knowing what they want. User stories are often a terse title and an empty description (no behavioral/functional specifications, no summary, no consideration for inter-dependencies among other user stories).

- Projects often lack clear direction. This point applies to my group and our project, but I think it might apply to other groups as well. There are many technical leaders in our group, but for our project, we lack a TRUE lead technical architect who:

1) has a clear vision of what the product should be like
2) plans architecture & development tasks for the group
3) mentors less experienced developers
4) maintains standards on code quality and development processes

Bottom line: If you're looking for a place to hone your technical skills and grow as a developer, look elsewhere. Some of the other reviewers who mentioned a culture of complacency absolutely hit the nail on the head. I have observed first-hand many times where our group has accepted mediocre work or shortcuts without hesitation ""if it gets the job done,"" creating more technical debt. When developers ask for time to address technical debt, we are rebuffed by managers who claim that it is ""good enough"" and that we should focus on pumping out more features. If you stay here too long, your skills as a software developer will only continue to rust.","Invest in your developers and encourage them to have high standards. Maintain those standards yourself, and don't ever let politics/pressure from above compromise the quality of your product.

For each project, appoint a true technical leader that everyone can follow, and encourage senior developers to mentor less experienced developers.

Cultivate a culture of software craftsmanship by respecting software development best practices. Raise the difficulty of the hiring bar, i.e. don't hire blindly based on a person's pedigree and evaluate each candidate based on their skills today, not what they accomplished many years ago.

The companies that Cisco acquired are mostly successful ones with talented engineers and development processes that work (otherwise they wouldn't show up on Cisco's radar). We should be working more closely with them and learning from each other.",Cisco

*  You need to address employee's fear -- rank & file are losing confidence that Cisco is a place where excellent work will result in continued employment, much less career advancement
*  The statements that employees are disaffected & disconnected isn't cause to lay off more of them: it's the logical consequence of the fact that Cisco is no longer an organization where it feels safe to be employed

There is almost always a way to reinvent or morph yourself given the wide range of opportunities.

The compensation has been pretty fair for the past decade or so. It really helped that I've had some top-notch managers that have gone to bat for me with HR. My last two managers have been pretty awful, but *all* of the ones prior had my back and helped me grow my career... even if they knew it meant I'd move on to bigger and better things. I can't state that strongly enough. I have never been as happy with my immediate manager in any job as I have been at Cisco (save the past year or two).

Cisco prides itself on hiring the right folks - as anyone subjected to the myriad of interviews can attest - and I have to say they generally hit home runs. 90%+ of the people I work with have been excellent, self-starting, and knew their stuff - or learned it on-the-job and jumped right in.","I know that Stack Ranking gets a bum rap, but you know who really likes it?.. folks who rank well and bust their backsides to get there. With the move to ""The People Deal"" (still have no idea WTF that means), Stack Ranking went away - as did the RSUs. I get nearly 1/3 of my total compensation from RSUs, so these are the ""golden handcuffs"" that keep me here. No more RSUs, no more cuffs, perhaps time to look elsewhere.

Why leave? I have been on the cutting edge of new markets for Cisco for be better part of the last decade. These are places where they make big bets, but quickly grow into a bureaucratic model that sells its soul to the first customer to sign a PO, then slowly drown and sink as that customer (or customers) weigh us down and not pivot with the rest of the market.

As I look around the landscape and view Cisco's attempts to pivot to Cloud and recurring revenue models, it is very clear that they are not learning from these failures. They burn out or run off all of the folks who could help prevent the next failure, thus do not learn the lesson. Or, in other cases, they do not allow enough time to get things rolling. You basically have 3 years to be #1/2 in the market - or else. 

Reference the recent death of Intercloud as an example of what I mean. They committed $1 billion to the project, but had a massively flawed business model from the start. After all, who can compete with AWS when it comes to plain IaaS? They were far too late to bring the other table stakes bits that go along with that (VPNaaS, LBaaS, FWaaS, Big Data as a Service, etc). Many of those were just about to launch when they canned the entire engineering portion of the project. One of the major distractions - and reasons for the delay in getting that stuff in place - was being saddled with their two external partners. These partners contracted one thing, then asked for a wildly different deployment model or Roles and Responsibilities. These held back any further evolution and improvement of the platform. 

Don't get me wrong: We screwed up alot, too, but those early commitments killed our velocity and ability to pivot.","Figure out what you want the company to be. If you are really committed to Cloud and a services-led model, understand these things take time. Don't pressure teams to get sales early. Yes, they have the resources of Cisco, but you can't have a startup-like group deliver at Cisco scale just because you don't want to wait for us to mature. Tossing cash at the issue isn't the answer (e.g.: Intercloud).",Cisco

The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.

The company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.","Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.

If you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.

While Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs.","In my time at Cisco I was a part of 3 different and distinct business units.  I enjoyed working for each of them and found that I was able to contribute value in every role I held.  What was painfully obvious to me was that the company is (or was) going through a bit of an identity crisis.  Consumer vs no consumer.  Social media vs no social media.  AWS like cloud offering vs Cisco cloud offering.

My advice to the leadership team is this.  We (Cisco for life) are *Cisco*.  *We* develop the standard for networking, infrastructure and cloud.  *We* are the industry leaders in our segment.  *We* stand a cut above and make no apologies for it.  Own being Cisco.  We don't need to compete with Apple, Facebook, Google, or Amazon.  *We* don't chase our competitors.  They chase us.",Cisco

Those promoted are not trained in managing people nor are they educated on company policy and process so when direct reports go to them for help it is seldom given.  The annual layoffs are unfortunately required as the company is poorly equipped to manage the bottom 10% out of the company, again, due to poorly trained managers and a weak performance management process.  I left on my own for a promotion but more importantly to feel valued, challenged and to get away from a really arrogant and incompetent management structure. I could have stayed and had the easiest pay check in the world but I respect my capabilities more than being a guy that fits the suit.","Truly get respect for the individual down and if someone is not a good fit, move them to where they can contribute or move them out.

The company, though, is growing very very slowly (5% would be a strong year), and not always in the hottest fastest-growth areas (cloud, security). So, it grows primarily through acquisition of other companies to bolster lackluster organic expansion. 

It's a bit like working at a utility company. Nothing too exciting. Shallow dips and small peaks; nothing to write home about. Nothing earth-shattering or particularly innovative on its own, so it acquires growth. In order to maintain steady headcount, layoffs are frequent and predictable.","As with most larger companies, there are departments and programs that are run well, and some to avoid.  

The Marketing & Communications team is an unmitigated disaster. Since a new Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) was appointed in mid-2015, there have been at least six layoffs of varying sizes in Marketing alone, with more always on the horizon. Marketing leadership has been decimated in a purge to remove anyone who might not be loyal to the latest CMO and her hatchet-man.

Very close minded to new ideas from the younger workforce. Probably due in part to the significantly older generation that dominates the workforce currently. I got the impression that older employees that hadn't established themselves at the VP/SVP/C-Suite/Director/Principle level were off put by younger engineers.

Not a hard working workforce as a whole. If you want to put in your 40 hours per week or less and have a life outside of work and not learn a ton of skills - probably a great place to work. If you want to pull 80+ hours per week and learn about cutting edge technologies and ""outside of the box"" problem solving methods - stay away.

Very much a ""think inside of the box"" and don't question the process environment. You are there to take orders and not address problems if you see them with the current structure.
