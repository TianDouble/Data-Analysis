If you work overtime, you get overtime pay at 100%, which is fantastic. As is pretty standard for the Defense industry, there is a program called 9/80, whereby if you work for 9 hours a day, you get every other Friday off. It's pretty great. 

There some tuition reimbursement, but it is contingent on your manager approving it. Up to 6% 401(k) matching with a 3 year vesting cliff is nice as well.

Lastly, Defense is a very stable industry that will always be around and never outsourced, which gives you enormous job security.","Being a defense contractor, the pace of work is painfully-slow. Contracts are always delayed by months, which can be very frustrating for young professionals looking to make a splash in their career and stand out among the masses. 

Moreover, there is a huge problem with knowledge sharing. The old guard is retiring or getting grumpy at all the work they are doing to support their programs because their colleagues of 20-30 years are retiring. There is incredible disorganization in onboarding materials and no clear system for how to learn the way Defense work gets done. Directors will point you to intranet websites with broken links, and there are few human beings who are dedicated to your continuous learning. It's all on you to ask questions, which makes you feel like a pest.

Lastly, senior management feels immensely disconnected from frontline managers and their engineers. They talk in lofty terms without understanding how hollow and aimless their strategies are.","Keep making efforts to raise base pay for engineers. You are competing with the tech sector, which is far sexier and pays more competitively.

4. Because their efficiencies are messed up and people do different things and sometimes have to work with less, your raise ends up subjectively based; oh and they rank everyone too, so everyone could be great employees, but you could get ranked poorly and have a lesser raise just because.
5. They spent ~$500,000 on a robot that sat the two years I worked there. Never worked and it's never been a ""real"" priority to make it useful. Although management will talk about getting it working. Or the 8 or so tables of floor space taken for a twist machine that took longer to twist than by hand...
6. Overtime. They expect you to work overtime and they usually need it to make up for poor management. If you don't and want some kind of lofe outside work, it'll reflect poorly on raises.

Now let's consider the location of the plant. It's on an Indian reservation where the price of everything is jacked up (including rent) due to being nowhere and because of all the oil money in the area. So most people commute from Minot which has the best rent prices. So now your ten hour day has about 2 1/2 hours of driving everyday and the company does not care.

Also half of the year will be winter and will get below zero for say 2 months of the year.

What else...no HR. So we had lots of employee conflicts due to bad management, people yelling at each other, toxic person in quality department, people were walking out in frustration, taking medical leave for mental health reasons. There was an instance of a hiring manager encouraging a certain employee to apply for a better position, but saying nothing to others that they knew were equally or better qualified.",Upper management needs some kind of check and balance on their authority. Otherwise they just do and care enough to look good for their bosses in California or corporate or wherever they are.

 - Urgent, quick-turn programs are forced to follow corporate processes.

     -- Most tools / processes from 1990.  Strict adherence required.
     -- Buying any material requires a chain of 4 people, one day of your time to hound them, and takes minimum of 2 weeks to receive.

*Local directors have lost respect of most technical staff.
 - Local directors sugar-coat all communication to the extent that it's a bad joke.
 - Local management culture prevents real-time negative feedback down the stack.
 - Negative feedback up the stack is not tolerated.  Warning first, then retribution.

* Site exists within a humans-in-seats division.
 - Local site lumped into a division focused on providing bodies in gov't-owned cubicles, for the lowest cost per hour.  
 - Local site's labor rates affect division's bill rates.
 - This means that local site's facilities are just overhead, and will be neglected.
 - This means that employees are strongly encouraged to always be billable.
    -- no process improvement budget
    -- no internal tool development budget

*Persistent Engineering Slow Brain Drain.
 - There are other local small defense companies persistently poaching anybody with any experience.  Management's sugar-coating exacerbates the problem.

*Zero feedback from staffing capability to sales expectations.
 - Local sales force and site management are strongly incentivized to sell, sell, sell!
 - Recruiting team is asked to fill or back-fill positions, to keep up with sales.  This task is impossible, due to qualifications, clearance, tight technical labor market.
 - As a consequence, there is more work than can be completed.  Anyone with any experience is stretched thin to cover as many projects as possible.
 - Management strategy has been to hire as many interns as possible, since qualified engineers are scarce.  Gotta bill the hours somehow, or director's bonus suffers.

* Beware the following pay-related stuff:
 - 401(k) match doesn't vest for 3 years for new hires.
 - part of 401(k) match withheld to end of calendar year (probably to help cash flow)
 - golden handcuffs:  tuition reimbursement, signing bonus, relocation expenses","Corporate:
 - Please sell this location to someone less inept, or at least let it run autonomously.
 - I'd love to work at Xetron, not Northrop Grumman.

 - Management turnover would be a good idea once in awhile.

 - Learn to be brutally honest with yourselves and others.  It's the only thing engineers respect.

Nice office with free (ok) coffee.,"Most of the Management and Senior staff are older people with pensions, and because of their pensions (NG ended these for new hires in mid-2008 and After) they never leave hoping to add another year of service because their pension increases with each year. Compounding this incompetence is hiring ex-military just for the $9,500 tax credit each brings. Two managers were ex-military and had less experience than I did and barely any secondary education (one had a 20-year old Associates and the other a Bachelor’s - both from small community colleges, meanwhile I have multiple degrees and academic honors from two nationally-known respected universities), and I was continuously showing the one manager how to do his job – unbelievable. In all, these incompetent older staff (with way too many retirement benefits) often express outdated ideas, have a serious lack of innovativeness, and often find themselves taking defensive positions because they learn later they were\are wrong, and ruining work life for the rest of us. As a result, new staff are hired at lower than industry average titles and pay, have little say in driving a project, and little chance for advancement. Not only are senior\mgmt tier of folks wrong in how to execute, sometimes it can be dangerous as I’ve seen company recommendations so outdated, it brought significant risk to the client’s project rather than lessen it. 

Moreover, because many have been at the company since before 2008, their salaries are beyond industry averages negatively impacting available dollars to hire good staff (resulting in lower salaries for new staff). For example, turnover rate for people with less than five years is high. You’ll meet staff who have been with the company 1-3 years, but less likely to meet anyone with 4-10 years of service, while many others are the senior and mgmt folks with 11+, 20+, or 30+ years. I left after 2.5 years – just couldn’t take the ineptness of the senior\mgmt folks anymore and their continually defending of other senior\mgmt’s staff incorrect work and their constant requests of me to help the older tenured folks look good by either reviewing their work or just doing it myself (b/c it was easier than trying to fix someone else’s mistakes).",Stop hiring Vets just because they are Vets. Company should seriously consider forcing the pension-tier folks out to make way for more contemporarily educated people who know what they are doing which too would help reign in future pension liabilities giving the company a chance for a brighter future in various ways.

They tend to hire from outside the company so much hope of getting promoted due to someone leaving  can be thrown out the window. Pay is low, though commensurate with the little they ask of you. 

People have a clock in and get out as quickly as possible mentality so chances to socialize with coworkers are rare, few people eat lunch together and have any fun....no fun northrop. The average age is quite high so I guess that should be expected. 

The regulatory requirements are so high you worry that so much as a sneeze will get your project audited for trivial requirements, many of which do not create value...this is driven by the industy regulation and not exactly Northrop, yet it is the type of thing one can look forward to by working in the defense industry. Not a good place for big-picture thinkers, this is a good place for fussy people who relish agonizing over fine print in their cubes.","1) Find high-potential people and help them get into positions in which they will thrive. This will improve employee engagement and reduce emplpyee churn.

2) Increase pay in Sillicon Valley so you can keep good people around. Most respectable engineers would rather eat seared ahi while getting their back rubbed by an SV masseuse than work in a warehouse.

3) Improve office conditions if possible, stock kitchens so employees can focus less on looking for plates, etc, and more time being productive. 

4) Improve morale by incentivizing people to work harder. Altering the performance structure would probably be the first step since their is currently no incentive to work hard.

5) Provide additional opportunities for non-engineeers to find rewarding work."

- Culture used to be very employee friendly though the good parts continue to be reduced.
- If working on a contract, then don't expect the company to care much beyond you continuing to bring in the revenue.","When there is a need to achieve synergies (cost savings) after a merger, the cloak and dagger style of dropping bombshells on business units, telling everyone they'll have no job in 2-3 months from now is unacceptable when there are viable alternatives available.  

Recommend next time you use your all-hands meetings to tell the staff that staffing reductions are needed to meet cost reduction targets over the next 12 months.  Then use employee friendly practices like hiring-freezes, and voluntary-separation packages.  This gives people enough time to find a new job, and it lets the people who remain feel like they need to rally together, tighten the belt, and meet the cost reduction targets.

There are many opportunities to work on many different programs. Good educational assistance for those who would use it (although the vest time has recently been extended)
-Flexible work schedule (in my case, anyway) which afforded a good quality of life.
-CEO is a very intelligent person and supremely qualified to lead the company.","-You can always get more work/responsibility here, but good luck getting them to actually give you the corresponding salary/title. 
-If you stay here more than two years, you are almost certain to be significantly underpaid
-Systemic incompetence throughout all parts of the company. Lots of people just going through the motion for a paycheck
-Many antiquated programs with old hardware/software
-Nonexistent training and mentoring
-Corruption/nepotism everywhere.  Many people in high positions because of who they know
-Ancient, really conservative leadership that don't understand that the younger group don't have any long-term incentives (i.e. pensions, etc.) and can't comprehend why everyone is leaving after 2-3 years.
-BWI facility is ancient and resembles a mental institution in some ways. Never ending hallways, dated carpet, etc.
-BWI is terribly overcrowded and has been for years.  Cubicles will often have 2-4 people smashed into each one. No semblance of privacy anywhere.
-No organization throughout the company. I didn't realize how bad it was until I joined my current job and saw the difference first hand. Be prepared to often be on your own to find answers for travel, training, programs, etc.
-No incentive to stay with the company. They recently unrolled a performance incentive that would pay up to $800 in your 401k if the company met its performance goals for the year. Seeing how Wal-Mart and Starbucks paid their employees more in bonuses this program falls very short
-Similar to above, the only way things will change is when you resign - then they will likely start trying to retain you. After years of the environment described above the efforts were too late.
-Performance reviews do not adequately reward performance. You will really devote yourself to a program, get a great review and nothing but excuses on why your raise was 3.5%. It was never really financially worth putting in the hard work and extra effort to obtain a top-level performance review.","This company and sector is going to have a very rough time in the future if there are no incentives to younger professionals to stay. Stop promoting people to high levels in the company based on who they know - it is really starting to show in the  lack of competency in certain areas of corporate leadership.

You are good if you are coming over with a increase in salary and new title. But HR looks out for the company not you, so good luck fighting for a raise or higher pay increase after a few years here, you stay here long enough you will see how low you get paid below average. Some management teams on some Program side truly have created toxic environments for their employees, favoritism is evident in a few teams so just be careful. Also in some teams, they lack real engineers. NGC here struggles to mold engineers that are truly strong in technical skills it seems. Other local companies produce better engineers in a couple years vs what NGC does here lately. I'd recommend coming over here after having some experiences elsewhere to be honest, but you can still enjoy your work and the program with plenty of other benefits.

Favoritism truly occurs within teams, the management that are really high up there unfortunately do not see that. It is also sad that they promise things to their people yet they come up empty, from the highest level to you program manager. Please look into taking care of the employees better or you will see more and more people leaving the company unhappy, with many years left to work in their career.

Initially I was excited to join the Northrop team. I had always heard that it was a great company to work for. Things did not turn out that way. First of all, it took me four weeks just to get a permanent badge. Second, I never got the federally regulated ""reasonable accommodations"" for my disability that I was promised upon completing the on-boarding application. Third, I never even got a chance to do any real work because I never received my classified computer. In the end, I was let go after five weeks because management deemed that I ""seemed uninterested in the role"" and apparently also thought I was looking for another job -- neither of which was true. They brought me into a small room and had the recruiter that hired me do the firing (temp-to-hire agency). They did not relay any concerns to me directly or speak to me about any problems they may have had beforehand, i.e. a warning. I feel completely blind-sided and that I never even had a chance, even though I never did anything wrong.","- Stop making assumptions about your team members

-People who work here are great, hardworking and strive for excellence. 
-Education Fund
-Great Benefits","-Culture is by far the worst thing here. If you don’t have a degree, good luck trying to move up the latter. You are treated like second or third class citizen compared to those with a degrees. 
-I worked here for 10yrs and within those years I had 22 bosses. The political management side is pretty disgusting, to say the least. They change/rotate managers faster then they give out raises. 
-All growth opportunities seem to be in-house and they rarely higher externally. Which is not such a bad thing if they gave externally a slight opportunity. 
-No degree, No growth - so sad, that their vision of excellence is measured by education only* and not experience. 
Although I have a degree, I see how people who have way more experience to do my job would never get the opportunity to even get considered for it even though they are more qualified to perform it. 
They need to take a page out of the tech industry (Google, Netflix, Microsoft) which higher regardless of a degree, but look at all aspects of someone’s ability to perform the job, and they do not let a degree automatically disqualify them. 
This is why they fail in keeping people and have such a fast turnaround of jobs here. Those without degrees get treated like 2nd to 3rd class citizens, and they will never grow once they reach their capacity.

-The irony of all this is that most of the managers here only have technical degrees with no business experience or education to help them be managers. This leads to a management style and thinking that is only limited to an engineering mindset. This is by far their downside to helping employees grow and feel they are worth something. They believe that management experience is only 20% and technical experience is 80%. If they would only switch these percentages the business and culture would grow tremendously, and their employees would be managed by someone who knows what they were doing. 

-If you have a degree you will be treated good, until you hit your capacity, and then they will push you to go get a Masters degree if you want to grow or make more money, regardless of your hard work or experience. 

I left the company, which was the best decision I have ever made. I now make double of what I would have made if I had stayed and worked towards a Master that I never wanted to get. I now have had the opportunity to grow and be considered into position not because of my degree but because of my experience and hard work. I have never been happier and less tressed then I am now. I work for an great company that sees my potential and not a piece of paper to prove my worth. I have made my new company millions within the span of a year, and I didn’t not need a degree to do that, only the opportunity to prove my worth. 

I will say that this is a great first company to work for as it will make you appreciate your second one so much more.",They should require Business Management Degrees just like they do with Engineers who need technical degrees.

When used, the corporate employee recognition system and internal career tools are great, but many managers don't use them. There are opportunities for internal lateral movement if you are unhappy, and the company will move you if it's reasonable (and you're cleared) without penalty. You're surrounded by lots of skilled people from all over the industry, so you can get a lot of perspectives if you're paying attention.","Don't bother if you don't already have an ACTIVE clearance. I took a borderline insultingly low offer based on the promise of a specific, exciting kind of work. The security clearance process has taken OVER A YEAR, and that's perfectly normal around here. The job I was hired for had to be back-filled and I got stuck doing a job I never wanted, for less money than I'm worth. My managers have done everything they can to help, but all the great things that NG has to offer are behind the clearance wall. It's not NG's fault - that's the business they're in - but understand that every promise they make you is conditional on the clearance. And ask your interviewer about the program you'll be on. The programs within the company are essentially their own companies, so take all the negative and positive reviews with a grain of salt. My roommate works for a different program, and his management and work/life balance are completely different than mine.

To this day, I still think the benefits are very good; there are many choices for medical, everything from premium PPOs to HMOs to opting out entirely (which some people do if their significant other has better benefits through another employer). Sure, it's probably not as generous as it was back in the 1990s, but where is that true today?

Also, management always treated me pretty well, and there was always some emphasis on life/work balance - some people took that more seriously than others, but if you weren't obsessed with rapidly shooting up the corporate ladder, it was always acceptable to have other priorities besides just work. And with a company this size, there were a lot of different opportunities, so I never got stuck in the exact same role for years on end.","I was in satellites, and ever since Northrop bought the company in 2002, I've noticed a slow decline in the space side of the business (in favor of the much larger aircraft side). There are many more opportunities in aircraft these days, and I started to  get the sense that corporate management wasn't all that interested in winning a lot of new space business anymore (just not nearly as much $$$ to be made as there is in military aircraft).

Many good, experienced/senior engineers are available - great for learning through Q&A.

Most of the time, IPT's are very experienced and quick to realize what is going on in the program.

Lots of opportunities and resources to learn new skills and methods.

Many programs available for you to get in.



Once each program/contract ends, your manager usually helps you get into another program (depends on manager and/or your sector though).

Good benefits - 
>>medical (value is declining over time, but still quite okay), 
>>DENTAL (especially great), 
>>vision, 
>>pension (have to stay in the company for 3 years, though), 
>>quite flexible and abundant PTO hours (3 weeks including 1 week off at the end of the year, and increases quite proportionally with length of stay at this company, but NO PAID SICK DAY),
>>education support (have to stay in the company for 2 years since the date company pays for the class(es) in exchange)
>>depending on your sector and your program, you might be granted a company laptop for you to work at home.","1.  Lots of bureaucracy and mismanagement that often leads to program failure : 

>>Program management scared of reporting ""bad news"" to upper management and hide it until the program  runs out of money - especially if they're the ones who caused trouble.

>>Lack of diversity in program management section: management experienced in one or two discipline(s) only (the one(s) they've been working for their whole life...), thus they really lack full understanding of how the WHOLE SYSTEM works   (sorry to say, but even interns and junior engineers can see it...).

>>For fast-paced programs, too many unnecessary meetings and documentation requirement exist. 

>>For fast-paced programs, company is NOT willing to pay as much as they need and usually start TOO late. 
>>>Upper management has very unrealistic expectation - thinks engineering problems are very easy to solve (as if it can be done with a click of a button when there were not enough software for the engineers to use!! They also were not willing to pay for development of such software...).



2.  LOTS of unethical behaviors not caught and not punished, because it was done one-on-one/privately and not left on paper.

> These are real-time examples:
>>Example 1, lots of managers look behind your back secretly when they pass by your desk/cubicle. For some of these managers, even less than a minute-long talk is not allowed. When they catch their employees talking for few seconds, they use that as an excuse to give you more work and less staff support for your team. This is especially apparent for tight-budget programs.

>>Example 2, some managers make junior engineers to do certain thing in certain method with very short period of time and they announce it to whole program members (without the junior engineer's consent). If it turns out that the methodology is wrong, they blame on the junior engineer for doing it wrong AND out of time. The manager then lies to his functional manager (who is also the junior engineer's functional manager) when he talks with the functional manager in his room. The junior engineer could not blame him, because the manager only directed him/her verbally, not through email (usually takes too long to explain through email anyway). 

>>Example 3, a fellow junior engineer stole another junior, but more senior engineer's effort/work (to make himself look better to the manager) and always criticize more senior engineer in front of his/her manager (again, to make himself look better compared to more senior engineer).

>>Example 4, a manager tells junior engineer during one-on-one end-of-year performance review that he/she has to work more ""green time"" in order to get highest score on performance review. The junior engineer is already overwhelmed (physically and mentally) with working overtime for his/her HIGHLY under-staffed section of program. Also, this is supposed to be illegal and the whole program contract is supposed to be terminated by the government if the government finds out about this. 
>>>FYI: The highest score yields only 3.0% to 3.5% increase in salary, which barely meets inflation. The score is only given to very few people among 100's of employees.



3. VERY HARD to get one level promoted - your level of expertise, your contribution, and length of stay does not matter. 
>>Company always find a reason to NOT increase junior engineer's salary, making the junior engineers to leave. 
>>Average salary increase rate is 2% - 2.5% per year for engineers - they can get at least 10% increase when they move to another company!!!!!
>>>Even after hearing about these, the managers still don't understand why more experienced, but junior level, engineers (level 2 to 4) leave...","Read both pros and cons.

Enormous corporation (80,000+ employees) means you cannot even begin to understand the high-level management structure. You will see congratulatory emails about VIP-level promotions for people you have not only never heard of, but couldn't even figure out their role if you tried.
Almost all of NG's business is from government contracts, most of which are defense related and a large portion of those classified SCI (the biggest exception is probably James Webb Space Telescope) This means lots of overhead, red-tape and process bloat. Be prepared for a one-line software code change to take 6 months and cost $1 million. SIGH.

Done def management once again.  Currently in the few years I have worked there, the upper management has changed approx. 3 times.  The lower level management isn't some of the best either.  They choose GREAT engineers with zero or no leadership skills and absolutely ZERO training, of course the obvious happens, leadership that tries to only make decisions that they will not get any heat from.    All the  employees are essentially thrown under the bus.  
The initial salary is okay, the raises are between 2-3%.  So far they are starting to cut anybody who higher than average salaries or even average salaries.

Moving packages are just plain dumb.  15k to move to a new place with little.  The company they use is, check this out, a subsidiary of Northrop, so they charge a premium to move your stuff to themselves, never mind the company is crap  and a half.  

PTO.... yea, when the hurricane came, they tried to make the people use their own PTO  for the forced plant closure. 

 What your specialty is may not guarantee you actually doing it.  MANY people are doing something totally different that what they are hired to do.  They did this with my manager and that person stayed 1 year to the day to finish out the contact and then moved on.   So the current procedure is to put you in a department where you have zero skill in, grade you as if you do know.

You get to see the right  side of the period as in .0 something. Most are at top of the unknown pay range hmmmm? No one knows their own pay scale? Why is that. Not asking what others salary might be but what is my pay band / scale.  sorry cannot show you.  Same 10 people keep getting promoted or receive another reorg of positions.

Does have and use training budget - so an employee can learn certain skills.,"Eliminated pension in 2008.  Has a 401K plan that is not very employee frriendly.  People hired pre-2008 can get a company match of 4%, but have to contribute 10% of their salary to get the Northrop 4%.  People hired after 2008 get a 6% match, but conditions are also hard to meet in order to get the full 6%.  Matching conditions are not easily discoverable.  Raise pool over time has become very unfriendly to employees.  Performance appraisal process is not connected to salary.  Employees get ranked based on how they meet their goals.  Then the company decides on a yearly basis what percentage of employees need to be ranked as Level 5, 4, 3 or 2.  Level 5 employees can get a decent raise, even in the 10% range.  But about 1/2 of the employees get a 0% raise - because so many people have to be ranked Level 3.  Then the salary decides what raise the person gets - if the employee makes over the mid-point salary of the employee grouping, the raise is likely to be 0% for all Level 3 employees.  This is incredibly demotivating for employees: they can work hard, meet or exceed all of their goals, and still get a 0% raise.  Years ago the company implemented a policy that disallows brining personal plants to the office - to eliminate using Northrop water for a personal plant.  Benefits costs are skyrocketing as the company tries to eliminate money it spends on employee benefts.  However, Northrop is truly a 1% company.  Executives are treated much differenty than non-management.  VPs and above receive large salary increases, as well as bonuses - while ~50% of the normal people get 0%.  Over years, the company has eliminated many grade levels - making it very difficult to get promoted.  It is a good company to work at for 2 - 3 years, but not for 10 or more.","Management insists that limiting large raises to Level 5 employees is good - becaise it motvates people to try hard to be a Level 5.  However, the percetage of Level 5 employees is too small and the common circumstance is that the employee works very hard, meets all goals, but can't crack the Level 5 group because there are so few of them.  And the employee gets a 0% raise.  Management claims not to think that this demotivates hard workers.  But managemet does not talk to the affected workers to get their views.  Management needs to understand that it cannot continue to take things away from the workers, and still expect them to be as dedicated as the company wants them to be"

Some of the projects can be very rewarding and challenging. Some of the management personnel do a great job of not micromanaging.","Northrup Grumman career advancement is mediocre at best as it is not determined by your impact, it's how big of bragging rights do you bring your manager on *their* résumé. 

Northrup Grumman salaries, at least at my site, are not great compared to competition. One of the not-so-brilliant incentives Northrup Grumman has employed for ages is a bonus.. that you get in 3 years.. maybe. Basically, if the company does well, you get the bonus in x years. But the criteria for what determines if you get the bonus is not concrete, just "".. if Northrup Grumman does well.."". In addition, you are sometimes competing against engineers that you'll never see, because they are not on site.. so prepare to not do as well as you'd expect because somebody somewhere that you've never met is better than you.

Due to the above point, Northrup Grumman has started letting in talent that would not be employed in past times. But since the salaries are not the best, the talent musts suffer. 

At the beginning of the year I strongly recommend taking a long vacation that goes well into January. If not, you'll be left stranded with no authorization to work as functional management and project management fight over who should be paying you during this ""transition period"". HINT: Neither end up paying you in my experience, so just avoid the headache and take an extended vacation.","Trend towards flexibility again.

They want me to add 20 words of pros but to be honest it's hard to find that many pros for this place.","I thought I had gotten the opportunity of a lifetime only to find out it was all a sham. Working in the supply chain dept at the Spectrum Center in San Diego is a living nightmare. Very toxic environment!
The managers are the worst I have ever seen. They lie to your face, promote backstabbing and gossip among employees. You can't complain to HR because they are friends with the managers and will make sure you never get promoted or able to move depts. You will only get promoted if managers like you regardless of experience, education or work performance. Preferential treatment is at all time high. Just suck up to that lazy manager and you get your way. If you aren't one of the favorites you might as well leave because your career and salary will come to a halt. 
The turnover is the highest I've seen,  PAs are always going out on disability or quitting but the managers don't care they can always fill the positions with contract labor. The managers have all gotten the positions because they are friends with the bosses wife or some else, they bring nothing to the table while sitting in their offices trolling their phones all day. 
PAs get blamed for pretty much everything when things go wrong. We are the punching bag of other departments. Programs don't realize it's a tough job pleasing programs and compliance and when you have unproductive lazy managers life is very hard. The processes and procedures PAs have to work with are so outdated it's unbelievable for a company this size. Sucking up to compliance is what PAs have to do all day every day for no apparent real reason. 
I have never been so stressed at work in my entire life and can't wait to find a new job like everyone else.",I beg higher management to really take a look at the managers toxic behavior and stop promoting managers with departments  that have high turnover rates. Please hire managers with real life experience and that can bring real value and positive change to this organization. Gens and Millennials will not tolerate this kind of work environment and will leave.

Although I had over fifteen years of experience when hired, it was my first experience working for a corporation of that size. Needless to say I had high expectations. To this day I am baffled by the mixture of positives and negatives of my experience there. 

First, the positive. Almost everyone I worked with was very friendly from the first day. Professional, courteous, accommodating etc. I was hired part-time on-call yet they gave me 40 hours per week for the entire duration I was there. I was given the software I needed and one of the managers in particular was very helpful in that regard. Most importantly, they also had me working on a very compelling project, the details of which I am unable to discuss here, that enabled me to use my skills in a broad manner. For these things I was grateful.","This company apparently has terrible management. One manager (not my direct manager) directly asked me to work for free. He asked me to work on something on my own time since he did not have the budget for it. Being part-time on-call, I felt compelled to oblige him in the hopes that it would lead to permanent employment. 

My immediate manager appropriated a budget that I was awarded for a project I had conceptualized. This individual took every dime of that budget, such that I could not even pay myself to manage the project. The funding was granted by those in authority high above us, yet there was nothing I could do. I expressed my concern three times to this manager. He actually said, ""I don't mean to cannibalize your budget, but ..."" Yet that is exactly what he was doing. After assuring me that that funding would be based on my needs, he sent me an email, at home, mind you, with a list of everything he had procured, and it consumed the entire budget. 

The creative director, while always friendly to me, had two large dogs following her around wherever she went. Yes, just like the show The Office, but these were giant poodles. Being part-time on-call, I did not have my own office. I began in a large community cubicle space, and I was then moved into a two-person cube. Problems with noise led me to ask for permission to move into a vacant office nearby. I figured that, given my experience and the fact that I was leading a project, I should have my own office. There was just one problem, however. The office was actually used by the creative director's dogs. Unfortunately for me, I was less important than the poodles.

This is actually the point at which I left the company. Perhaps revealing my own naivety, I never imagined such things happening at a company like Northrop Grumman. I considered sticking around, in the hopes of advancing or opening other doors, but in our weekly meetings, on more than one occasion, management made it clear that there was no room for advancement at this particular location.

In summary, great people, poor management. I have no evidence that this reality is systemic. The feeling I got was that, in a hiring market, they can choose anyone they want to work there and they will have no problem finding individuals who will tolerate a reality such as I described. If you are ambitious and have self-respect then make sure you ask appropriate questions when interviewing.","As hopefully evident by my experiences, management needs to see human resources as ""people"" and not as ""resources"" that are expendable."

Each sector of the corporation operates with many projects that offer plentiful development opportunity for those that stay long enough and endure the hardship of living with minuscule pay in high-cost areas.  A lot of development resources are available to anyone with the equipments and time to access them.,"Each sector of the corporation operates independently with seemingly zero synergy.  The legacy Information System sector was the cheapest sector of the corporation that offered woeful compensation package.  IS was the only sector that stopped pension and other retirement programme to supplement 401K.  Therefore any legacy IS employees in the current corporate structure will have to make do with working with colleagues that collect much more handsome salaries and retirement package.  Transfer between projects is a simple change of job locations and description because salary raise is never a possibility.
Work-life balance is non-existent for ground-level employees.  Managers cannot be bothered to say 'thank you' when one works through the night to deliver something to make deadline and overtime work is never paid.  Anyone foolish enough to demonstrate loyalty and dedication is rewarded with an universally given 3 for average for annual performance rating.  As with annual salary raises, anything above 2.5% should be considered a gift from God.  There is hope however because favouritism is rampant.  Anyone lucky enough to secure a senior manager's affection or has connection with high-level leadership can walk the easy paths paved with rose petals.
The company spends a lot of money on employee development but only if employee has a company computer to access the resources.  For everyone else that uses only project computers hopes and dreams is the only available option.
For anyone that hopes to join because Northrop Grumman was the maker of the F-14 Tomcat and the B-2 Spirit, look elsewhere.  Those glory days are long gone and never again.","For a company likes to boast and gloat about its products of quality, it certainly has an interesting way of treating the people that build those products.  With the hundreds of billions spent on lobbying (wining and dining politicians and defence acquisition officials) but suffers persistent retension problems with young engineers I humbly suggest the following; you aren't the only show in town and the sooner you realise it and invest in your people the better it will be for everyone in your organisation."

I had the opportunity to work on a team that gave me exposure to a multitude of different Software groups and platforms to develop on. The type of work you do here is difficult to find outside of the Defense Industry, and on top of that, Northrop Grumman is a leader in the industry for ""smarter"" vehicles such as UAVs.","1. Despite Northrop being the supposed leader in UAVs, it's software practices are terribly out of date. It's partially due to the industry and the length of the projects though. When a new project starts up, new tools are used and implemented, however those same tools will be used the entire way through, even if the project is more than a decade old. Trying to upgrade these tools or acquire new tools is a constant fight uphill with IT and layers of approval from upper management. 
2. Another con is not really a fault of NGC, but rather a reality of the industry. They are government contractors, and therefore bill the government a certain amount of man hours. This requires Software Engineers to always clock the hours. This is very out of the norm compared to the rest of the industry and takes a bit to get used to. 
3. There was a recent change to the rating program that rewards the top performers in the department with high score (5 or 4), normal performers with an average score (3), and poor performers with a poor score (2). This score is used to make the argument for raises and promotions for employees. On paper this sounds great, however a key detail is that only the top performers in the entire department are rewarded. This means even if you're a top performer in your own group, you can and probably will be passed for a higher score because only a percentage of 5's and 4's in the entire department. Managers convene to fight for the employees to get better scores, and use info written up by employees to help their argument. This is similar to the private sector, but I feel like it is handled a bit worse at NGC.",Less management.

Even though I really liked my position at SRA I decided to make the change because of a little more pay and primarily because it allowed telecommuting.  Not mentioning names, but the person who hired me did so very much out of self interest and did not explain to me the true nature of the contract I was joining.  After giving up my position with SRA and already working for NG I noticed many people were leaving for jobs with other companies.  It quickly became apparent my position was potentially very short with only a slight chance of joining the next contract. I would like to think this was as much a surprise to NG as it was to me, but I think that is naive thinking. It was pretty clear NG hired me to fill the gap until they completed their short term contract.  (In all I worked there about 7 months).  NG made some half hearted attempts to find me a new position on a new contract, but I was mostly a disposable piece to their financial puzzle.  Beware and ask lots of questions if you are joining a contract position with NG.  Dont assume they have your best interest in mind.",Work harder to find employees work on new contracts.

Excellent 401k program,"Company has changed its management approach to focus almost entirely on the shareholder, with the customer coming second and the employee coming in last. Lots of focus on “Engagement” which puts significant burden on line managers to improve morale but then VPs cut employee’s benefits which makes this impossible. Significant benefit reductions during the last 5 years with removal of the traditional pension, huge increases in health benefit costs, stagnant raises, and bonus plans that are based on VP’s favorites not accomplishments. Recent employee evaluation system has alienated 70% of the workers that are now identified as average and good raises and bonuses only going to the top 30%. This seems reasonable but the evaluation system is subjective not objective and gives the appearance if not the reality of only rewarding senior management’s favorite employees.","Stop cutting benefits if you really want an engaged and talented workforce. Don’t waste time on non-value added benefits and provide quality health care for a reasonable price. Don’t cancel benefits that you have promised employees for years (pension, health) – demonstrates to all employees that the company can’t be trusted to stick to its employee agreements. Hire the best, talented, and qualified managers for senior positions not just who you know and like. Be careful with hiring people that meet your diversity quotas as this is another code for discrimination – if you hire the best, talented, and qualified people you will get a diversified set of employees."

Please stand up for your employee's and do not promote repeat offenders to management positions so they can continue their abuse... Give people raises based on not only their seniority but also on their performance and merit and for going above and beyond. Also would be nice if the PM's weren't the only one's receiving bonus' after all its a team effort bring in business and build what is required... The PM's don't do it on their own so why should they be the only one's who get the big bonus. If the whole team works hard to make it happen the whole team should be rewarded."

-Decent benefits, stock options, healthcare etc.
-9/80 Schedule","Where to begin....
-I was hired fresh out of college as an industrial engineer. I was told the position would be more oriented towards lean manufacturing and support. Currently, I run reports and make charts that track how production is progressing rather than actually help production be more efficient. In short, we produce reports, management looks at reports and yells at lower levels to do better. It's abusive and a complete waste of talent. I'm an engineer being paid an ok salary to click buttons.

-Old and Slow. Business has been slow the past few years and Aerospace Systems continually has been cutting investment. I've never seen a company rely so much on people and machines and then unwillingly invest in them. We literally run machines  24/7 in order to meet schedule, neglect preventative maintenance and when they catastrophically fail, wonder what happened. The same is true of employees.

-No training, expectation of perfection. I received about an hours worth of training my first day from a co-worker who had been there 30 years and acted as if I was imposing on their time. People are busy, but lacking any formal training or investment in people is egregious. Worse, it's just sad when management fails to give you that training and expects your work to be perfect on the first go. Further, people don't help until their butt is on the line. Otherwise, you tend to be on your own.

-Huge age gap. Aerospace has been struggling lately and has held onto many tenured employees, while laying off less tenured ones. They then hire in new graduates to back fill a 30+ year employee. I have no problem against older employees, but when you're the only 20 something in a group...you know there's something wrong. To compound that, the company is bleeding younger folks. Most 20 somethings I've met in the company are looking for other jobs outside of Northrop.

-I feel bad for my managers. Management works about 60+ hours per week, constantly on their blackberry or responding to e-mails. They don't have time to mentor or even meet with employees on a regular basis. Adding to that fact, most of them don't know how to manage. On a regular basis I watch managers berate employees. They ask for turn around times on tasks that are rather impossible and then insult employees when they can't meet those expectations.

-Raises. I received a 2% raise my first year. This is barely in line with inflation and laughable at best. I've met many folks who've come out of retirement to assist Northrop from ""the glory days"" and they are some of the best and brightest people I've ever met. The company has retired them, cut salaries and recruited cheaper, but less adequate managers whom can't manage and are generally miserable people.

-Old facilities. My workplace has not been touch in 20+ years. The carpet is old and stained, computers are slow and the floors are peeling up. The companies attitude shows in its neglected and antiquated buildings.","I hope you get another good contract so you can hire better people and have a massive cultural overhaul.

Been with the company for almost 8 years. Depending where you work, it's like prison. You have to pick a clique to survive here as it's every man/women for themselves. Your co-workers that you thought were your friends at work will not waste anytime to throw you under the bus to make themselves look better. HR seems like they are always on the prowl to get people fired right away. If you don't work for the Aerospace Systems sector, they treat you like the red headed step children. Meanwhile the Aerospace Sector would get bonuses for saving the customer money and give everyone else cake. Don't get me wrong, I'm just lucky to get a paycheck but everyone should be treated equally if they want everyone to go by the motto ""One Site, One Team!"". No matter how hard you work and go out of your way for the company, they will not waste no time at all to point out each and every little mistake you've made. The pay is ok, but could be way better. When I first started with the company it had that family vibe, that is until all the good people left either by retirement or promotion and then  that's when the corporation vibe came in. It went from higher ups knowing you personally by name to now you're just a number. They stress on the importance of people taking these Ethnics training classes annual which is a waste because the company does not follow what they preach. Example, one of the quizzes they give they talk about a gentlemen who's daughter was going to college and wanted to join the company as an intern. Her father happened to know/work with the Manager for the intern spot. They give you multiple choice answers, A). You tell the father that his daughter must apply online like everyone else B). The father gives the Manager his daughters resume and the Manager brings her onboard. Which one is the right way to handle this? Obviously A) was the correct answer however, I have seen instances where apparently the company believes B) is the correct answer on what seems to be on a daily basis. This ""Job"" is just a place holder for me until I add a few more experiences on my resume and will leave. Defiantly not a company you want to put 100% effort in everything you do and not be recognized and then treated like crap.  Lastly, biggest pet peeve with the company; not once I have meet our newest VP's and Vice VP's. Before or best VP and Vice VP left for better things they used to walk around greeting everyone individually, asked how they were doing, and asked if they needed anything. Now we get these newer folks that have not even introduced themselves to anyone; I guess as long as they get there bonus checks every year based off of our hard work there is no need to meet them.",

Also, allow employees to use their FSA funds towards the plan deductible before drawing from the HSA account.

However, I am not able to have the visit count towards my annual deductible but pay it from my FSA account.

Especially if you're a new grad, you can easily make tons of friends here.  But even if you're not, everyone I ever met at NGC was extremely friendly.

It is very hard to get fired.  You literally have to punch someone.  Though I did hear about a year after I left there was a round of layoffs.  They didn't sound horribly bad though.

There are some interesting projects, I think.  With all the clearances, it can be hard to tell!  You have to get on the right project.

If you are a huge superstar, you have the opportunity to rise to the top of a gigantic corporation, which would be cool.

Even though there are a ton of cons for NGC Rolling Meadows, I still have a soft spot in my heart for it.  It was kind of like boot camp for the real world.  Like really painful Navy SEAL bootcamp, but still.  Somehow I can't bring myself to give it only 1 star.","The way I was treated at my Rolling Meadows job was kind of insulting.  My degree is in EE at the University of Illinois.  I spent the bulk of my 2 years there soldering tiny parts on boards, moving lab equipment around, and getting other people's mail (yeah, really).  It was fine to be doing that stuff for the first 6 months, but after that, yeah.  Got a lil ridiculous.  By the time I decided to leave, I was worried that I couldn't find another job in EE because NGC hadn't given me any marketable skills - and in fact I ended up switching to a different career altogether.  I really should have left after a year... chalk it up to inexperience.

It is definitely still the Old Boys Club there.  I'm a woman, and I personally experienced 2 incedents of sexual harrassment during my time there.  I didn't report them - again with the inexperience.

People who work there fall into mostly 2 categories.  1) New grads who don't know any better.  They're fresh out of college and happy just to have a job, even though they are getting paid peanuts and have 0 extra benefits to show for it.  99% of them eventually figure it out and move on before their 5 year anniversary (like me).  2) Lazy people (aka people who had kids before figuring out that this job sucks).  These people don't have the energy to look for a new job.  They just want to cash that paycheck each week and not think about it.  These are the people who will stand in the lab talking to you for 45 minutes, or surf the web for 2 hours each day.

Finally, the benefits SUCKED!  The pay was way below average for my skill level and the location.  The office was boring as all heck - cubical land with no windows and 0 extra effort put into making it look nice.  You can't have cool tech gadgets like iPhones or anything if you work in a secured area.  There were no windows anywhere.  Part of the reason I left was, one day I pictured myself 20 years down the line at NGC sitting in a windowless room soldering tiny parts, and just realized, this was no way to live!","Hah, not like anyone will actually listen to me.  But, how about, instead of bulk-hiring 1000 new grads each year, do a more careful interview process and only hire 200, and pay them a bit more?  You could save money and spend it on improving the office environment and culture a little bit.  Also, cull the herd.  Get rid of the people who are not performing so that the ones who are can feel more like they are part of an elite group and less like a cog in a wheel.  Finally, you may think you have curbed the sexual harrassment problem, but you haven't."

They afford the employ an opportunity to travel world wide, Telecommute, flexible shifts and reasonable time off for work life balance. The projects and aircraft are amazing in their capabilities, employees can be proud of their accomplishments. The culture is generally a family of friends making things happen. They look out for one another and offer assistance and guidance where needed. The benefits are reasonable as tis the compensation.","Northrop Grumman has many Sectors. None of which are created equal for various reasons. This makes for an environment of the ""Haves"" and the ""Have Not's"". Many employees are jealous of other sector employees because of their benefits, schedules and general work life culture. Northrop Grumman Technical Services is the worst offender of this in my experience. They have poor benefits, expect way too much from their employees and pursue unrealistic goals. Some of the Senior Leadership have a ""Bully"" mentality where middle Management are afraid to speak freely for fear of reprisal. Expect layoff's every couple of years and don't think you are safe from being escorted off the property with no notice. (A very humiliating practice) This is especially true for Contractors, they are hired on and let go frequently.  Those of us who have the intestinal fortitude to stand up for what is right, are short lived in the Technical Services Sector.","Regardless of your position in the company or your level of education, all people should be treated with respect at all times. Those of you in Senior Positions who threaten and use bullying tactics to accomplish your mission should attend a few more Leadership conferences. You are only as successful as your work force. Once you have shown your true colors your workforce will lose respect for you and performance will be affected. As for employee engagement, try bring genuine. Engagement Survey's don't work. Acting upon the feedback from employees should be an everyday part of your responsibilities, not a forced project to account for and take credit for doing what you should be doing anyway. Finally, my best advice to the Management is; Senior Corporate Leadership needs to take a step back and evaluate the Sector Leadership and the manner in which they are executing their duties. Ensure that they are in line with the Northrop Grumman Values and are nurturing the workforce to become the best that they can be. Take an interest in these ""Glass Door"" reviews and take action on any that are negative. Even one negative review is to much."

Some of the nicest and smartest engineers you will ever meet.  Flex schedule is an option for some, 9/80 schedule,  straight time for overtime, they do have medical/dental/401k.  Onsite gym is great, cafeteria is pretty good.","Used to be wonderful at NGC Rolling Meadows - has gone so far downhill it makes people want to cry.  Many are counting the days to retirement (there’s even an app for that), or stuck due to other reasons and hanging on by their fingernails.  Everyone who CAN leave is looking.

Things to beware of:  Benefits are below other defense contractors and absolutely not close to the Chicago commercial companies –pay raises are tiny if not 0% (a chunk of employees get 0% every year), and for several years raises were on an 18 month cycle (only in Rolling Meadows, with no reasonable explanation). 

Your management will not stand up for you or have a backbone.  If someone is gunning for you (this happens frequently) you can be walked out at any time.  Senior management and Directors in Engineering are almost invisible (on purpose) so that ‘the other guy’ sticks out and can be targeted.  VPs seem unbelievably ineffective.  

Huge problems are appearing in multiple product lines, can be directly traced to year after year of engineering layoffs, all while trying to hire new grads (i.e.: CHEAP labor).  Some issues are so crucial that customers are yelling at the CEO directly.  Final product testing that is customer-viewed had to be CANCELED DURING THE TEST because of repeated failures. It’s embarrassing.

Everyone is now afraid of HR and/or Sector ‘leadership’.  A previous review from a new hire states she didn’t inform HR of 2 sexual harassment incidents - VERY smart move.  Generally, HR will simply ignore you.  If you push for your rights -  HR will target you as a “troublemaker”.  Corporate claims “retaliation is not tolerated” – right.  Retaliation happens ALL the time (multiple people who ‘stuck their head up’, reported something to HR, have been told by HR they should quit, and their lives have been made so difficult that some have quit).  

The word ETHICS is rammed down employees throats until we choke on it, but it’s just  a club to beat the employees.  Lots of employees ethics complaints go uninvestigated, unless it is of use to NGC (no visibility into the ethics “process” is allowed, so the employees are left wondering).  If there are any ethics complaints against HR, they are investigated by…. HR (I’m SURE HR will have no problem explaining away the ethics of that).  Unqualified minorities are routinely put in positions simply so HR can ‘check the box’, be prepared to do your job and theirs because SOME people “have to be protected” (direct quote from a staff meeting).

Be prepared to lose a few civil rights if you work her - NGC rewrote the rules a few years ago and employees CANNOT sue NGC.  You have to go through “mediation” – guess who picks the mediator?   

Advice for new hires:  
•	If you must come here, get a VERY high salary coming in (NGC is famous for low-balling – explains why something like 75% of offers are rejected these days).  
•	Find out who the “protected, special people” are and KEEP AWAY from them.  
•	Avoid HR at all costs.
•	It’s more important WHO you work for, than specifically WHAT you are doing.  A few managers are truly good people and good managers. If you want to be here for a while, find them.
•	Do not stay long, or your skills will be specifically for defense contractors, and this is the only one in the Chicagoland area.",Start paying attention - the golden goose is being drowned.

Pay raises are trivial, less benefits even though rates escalate. Resources are difficult to come by and staff members always worry if they are the next to fall. 
The challenges that NG is facing are not uncommon to defense contractors, but I fear that a company that has traditionally been an industry leader is fading into just another government contractor. NG has recently released a new series of TV ads that depict NG as continuing to be a cutting edge company, and in many ways they still are. However, in an attempt to continually increase sales the company seems willing to chance any contract that might have funding, regardless of its within NG’s core competencies.  This change has had dramatic impact on traditionally stable knowledge base of the NG staff. NG management is funding capture efforts that often require the company to hire new skill sets at the expense of legacy personnel. The result of this behavior is that individuals are frequently worried about the future and are more aware of external job opportunities. People who would gladly enjoy a lifetime career at NG are now always on the lookout for an exit strategy. If you look long enough you will find something …","Consider the following:
1)	What is the ratio of employees who directly impact our deliverables to those that do not?

I did not work as an engineer; my managers had no clue as to how to increase my productivity (by removing large obstacles), nor how to identify the root cause(s) of the systemic process failures, much less eliminate them.

This company is prone to booms and busts - massive hirings and massive layoffs.","Again, this pertains to functions outside of Engineering: too many managers within Northrop have done the lemon dance by failing in their manager roles at previous aerospace companies. Too many managers resent the responsibilities that are expected of leaders. Business strategy is a useless discussion because most managers lack advanced degrees (or bona fide degrees at all), so they focus solely on tactics: what's the status of the status of the status of the status? Let's schedule daily meetings to report status - no better: let's have daily status meetings twice a day. Let's micromanage our workers until they spend more time statusing instead of doing. The key to get to retirement without getting canned is to smile up and kick down.

Advice to upper management: each time you do a reduction in workforce, you add to an already inverted pyramid (speaking in terms of cost, of course) by eliminating the doers. The managers, directors, and VPs draw the highest pay, but don't run the machines nor do the paperwork that sustains the day-to-day operations. Yes, you have eliminated redundancy among directors and VPs, which is a huge step in the right direction. Figure out a way to identify the lemons among your mid-and-upper level managers. If you can't VRIF them, you'll get a healthier bottom line by paying them to stay home. Keep in mind, you're having to do RIFs not only because of DoD spending cutbacks, but also because you employ a multitude of apathetic, inept, and bullish managers who fail to meet the demands of leadership."

Sometimes non-working group members may have invaluable insight which may lead to a better solution. Cultivate an open communication among employees, and catch and reward good behavior; the reward doesn't have to be monetary.

Opportunity to do some real hands-on engineering work.","There is entirely too much management at this company.  There are Engineering Project Managers, Program Managers, Logistics Program Managers, Engineering Functional Managers, the list goes on.  There is an overabundance of people trying to direct the work, and never enough people who are actually doing the work.

Engineering Supervision (Engineering Functional Management) is almost completely broken.  These people are the direct supervisors of the engineering staff, and have an outsize effect on the quality of work coming from the engineering organization.  And yet, they are consistently staffed with people who are duplicitous, incapable of critical thought, and unwilling to stand up for their people.

The constant push for more diversity has gone completely out of control.  People are hired not because of their skills, but because of their gender or race.  Unqualified people are promoted up the ranks in order to fill a diversity quota.  It’s maddening how much this occurs, and incredibly frustrating.

Compared to other defense contractors, there is a very small number of military veterans working here.  This is true at both the worker-level, and in the management ranks.  Military experience isn’t valued.  Very strange for the defense industry.

Programs and projects are always in a state of chaos.  The only way things ever get done is via last-minute scrambles.  Management treats this as the norm, and the “way things have always been done.”  Efforts to institute some semblance of planning always fall on deaf ears.

For the past couple years, there has been a significant trend in engineering staff.  People start here early in their careers, many fresh out of school.  They start very motivated and dedicated, but after 3-5 years, they all leave for elsewhere, bitter and jaded from the experience.","For the past 10-15 years, we’ve enjoyed a virtual flood of money from the Pentagon and our allies.  It didn’t matter if we treated people poorly, had ineffective management, bloated staff, or any other ills.  The money just kept coming, no matter how poorly things were run.

The flood is over.  The flow of money is slowing to a trickle.  And now all of the poor decisions of the past decade are being laid bare.  You let a lot of engineering talent walk out the door.  You promoted a lot of the wrong people.  You’re left with this incredibly dysfunctional organization, that’s now going have to fight tooth and nail for every defense dollar.

You need to start looking at how the company is going to survive the next 10-15 years.  I’d start by taking a good long, hard look at all of the people you have in engineering functional management positions.  Relative to the size of the company, engineering functional management is a small number of people.  But this small group of people has an incredibly outsized impact on how programs are run, and ultimately how successful the company is."

They also allow a 9/80 schedule which is a big plus! Pay is decent.,"Seniority over attitude. Policy consistently result in the best and brightest leaving (e.g. requiring relocation across the country, only seriously considering the opinions of the grey beards)

Middle management, in my experience is extremely lacking in this technology company. This is across the spectrum from technological understanding to work practices. For instances it's commonly acceptable for management to make statements like ""I really don't understand this, its for the smart people to understand"" in regards to basic technology concepts like ethernet or Linux. Management also values working overtime and doing nothing higher then working 8 hours and accomplishing task. The more hours you sit at your desk, there is just an assumption that your actually doing more. There is also no vision or risk taking whatsoever and this costs the company overall in loss of contracts due to stagnation. Middle management also cannot identify key people and skill levels of the employees.

I will say though, that this is my experience at one location, other sectors and locations may or may not be different.","Take some chances, not just on technology but people. Consider promoting based on merit, enthusiasm and ideas rather then just years in service.

Also work harder to retain good people. I've seen some great people leave due to lack of opportunity. Some of these people cannot be replaced and can be extremely productive.

Constant cuts to benefits are a clear signal to employees to look elsewhere. Management should address this to retain good employees"

Pay might be below the rest of the big defense contractors, but it's a good stable job.","If you're young and you're a software engineer, I would recommend not working here. If you love to code and love to work with the newest technologies, DO NOT WORK HERE.  Northrop is great if you like the government culture of a 9-5 job, but if you're like me who loves to code, I would not recommend this place as a starting job out of college. The people here are nice, but they don't know what it means to explore and research new technologies. NG is more of a systems integrator IMHO. Because they are bound by contracts, gov't clients are very slow and don't understand what software is. They only care about buzzwords like ""Cloud,"" ""Big Data"", ""OpenSource,"" but they don't know what they mean. 

Overall, if you're young and you're a developer, I would not recommend working at any defense contractor. If you want to know what it's like to work for a startup or any other commercial company, then you should DO IT.

If you have a family and want a stable job, I would recommend this place. It's 9-5 and within my group the people here are nice.",Don't be so stuck on government. Explore what's out there.

Benefits are good.
Technology has potential and room for growth and innovation.","This is particularly for the Woodland Hills, CA campus.  NG is a large corporation; experience at other locations will vary vastly.

The leadership and management are highly unqualified, directionless, and do not plan and work for the company's products, future, well-being, and employees in mind.  If you are successful, you will find yourself suddenly surrounded and being led by five or six bosses and ""leads"", none of which were around before your success and none of which will contribute in any significant and valuable way.  Often the ""leaders"" wound up creating negative work, slowing down your progress, and draining your budget or siphoning it for unrelated efforts.

As mentioned before, the technology has great room for growth and innovation.  However, behavior of the leadership and management often meant any good idea or opportunity for innovation will be hampered down by excess and ground to a halt by inefficiencies and bad planning.  More often than not the company seemed to be following trends, rather than being a leader or even at the forefront of technology.

A good engineer will have job security. But your professional career, skill set, and experience will stagnate and flat-line.  If you ever find yourself out looking for an opportunity, you will be hit with the hard reality that you are no longer competitive in the job market and, by extension, out of touch with your contemporaries in engineering and technology.

The environment is highly volatile and non-conducive to engineering.  Budgets are constantly being raided, employees are constantly being shifted around, resources are constantly being over and reallocated, and far too much time is spent in meetings and demonstrations.","There isn't much to say.

Northrop Grumman is not your standard mom and pop company - the company can really push into markets with their clout and get you into some really cool projects.
Northrop Grumman has big name suppliers, which means when cool new gadgets come out, your project may be able to get a hold of them a little bit before everyone else.

This means that if the defense budget is cut, it likely also means that they'll need to cut back somewhere.
Northrop Grumman, like many defense contractors, often needs to hold on to people with subject matter expertise, even if they are not on contract, so you may find your team ""padded"" with these individuals.
Many managers don't believe in paying you for hours above and beyond your ""full-time"" status (referred to as Extended Work Week), but will imply that you should do it anyway.  There are managers that will allow this kind of charging, though.
Career paths are very murky - it's very unclear how to climb the ladder.","If I could share advice with upper management, it would be twofold:
1.  Don't be cheap and take more risks.  If you want innovation, you have to try new things and be prepared to fail a lot before we get it right.
2.  If you want to engage your employees, you need to do four things.  Give them projects that are improving someone's life - a soldier, a doctor, whoever.  Give them projects that require meeting new people and actually leaving their cubicles - the ""butts in seats"" view of work doesn't cut it.  Give them training that gives a clear view of how their work fits into the grand scheme of things - without context and clear goals, people won't feel any urgency or have a desire to be a team player.  Offer more rewards for achievement - if people don't feel like they will ever recognized for their work, they won't try as hard when you need them the most."

For newer employees there is a reasonable 401K matching program and a generous company funded savings program.  The holidays vary based on sector with Electronic Systems and Corporate having the best holiday schedule, followed by Aerospace Systems, then Information Systems and Technical Services.  Vacation and sick time are combined into accrued PTO (Paid Time Off), and the allotment is standardized across the corporation and based on the number of years you've been employed by the company.  They have a good tuition reimbursement program.  There is also an excellent employee discount program that includes supplier price for US auto manufacturers, Home Use Program for Microsoft products, special pricing on GE appliances, and many others.  For positions with travel requirements, travel arrangements are typically made by the employee through the company approved online travel site, except for international travel which must be booked over the phone.  Business class travel is allowed for international travel where the total travel time including layovers in a 24-hour period exceeds 12 hours.

If you're interviewing, ask to speak to some or the people that would be your teammates/counterparts (alone if possible).  Find out how long they've been in their positions, if they're happy with their position, career prospects and management, and what happened to the person who was in the seat you're interviewing for.  If you end up in a bad seat within the company, there are no internal safeties - it will likely be tough to get out of that group without switching companies, and the yearly review process can be manipulated to make even a stellar employee look like a flunky.","There should be better mentorship and a formal grooming program for future management.  Also, an employee review of their direct management should be included in the yearly review process.  The employees' review of their management should account for a substantial portion of the manager's total review score.

My current project is great and is the only reason I am still with the company.
- Pay seems to be competitive with other large companies like Northrop Grumman.","- The company has changed from having a long-term focus and developing its employees as a vital resource to just hiring and firing whoever they need for a project. There is no job security and you will be laid off as soon as your project is complete.
- The benefits used to be okay, but the company is cutting our benefits (like paid vacation) to save money. This is disturbing since the company is profitable and the senior officers are paid millions of dollars a year, while the actual engineers are treated worse each year.
- It's become difficult to get money or other resources to do research or pursue technology that might benefit a customer. The company doesn't invest much in research anymore.
- The company has become less agile over the last few years and now it's almost impossible to get a computer that's ideal for your work needs or to get permission to install needed software like VMware Workstation. The IT and other departments now make their own jobs easier at the expense of those of us who actually do the engineering work for our customers.","My immediate management is competent and caring. The levels above that, all the way to the top, appear to be either unsure what to do or concerned only with saving their jobs and profiting themselves and the shareholders. No one I know feels valued by the company and we all know we can be laid off at a moment's notice no matter how exceptional we are.

Northrop Grumman has a toxic work environment. Many of the best people n my operating unit have already left and more are leaving soon. I am still with the company only because I like working on my current team and doing great things for our customers, and my colleagues feel the same way. If our project ends, we will all move to new companies.

This is a challenging time for Northrop Grumman, but the senior management's approach to improving the company's profitability has driven away most of the most talented engineers in my operating unit and those of us left will leave if/when our project ends. I'm not sure how to fix this situation, but I can tell you that reducing benefits and making it harder to do our jobs with increasing bureaucracy is not the way forward. Also not helpful is the fact that when you moved the headquarters from California to Virginia, you paid (or overpaid) all the expenses of senior management, who already make millions of dollars a year. When a great engineer sees that the senior management makes ridiculous amounts of money to make dubious decisions, and that the future of Northrop Grumman depends entirely on questionable forces out of his control, he begins to look elsewhere. The Engagement surveys are also a slap in the face of the line workers. It should be obvious why people are becoming less engaged over time and having managerial work groups will not improve the situation."
