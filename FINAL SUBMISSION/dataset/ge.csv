Overtime is not required on paper but is required for teams to meet production goals—at the end of the day the only thing that truly matters is output numbers. Policies constantly change based on the current site consensus. Gatekeeping tactics are being implemented with the tech level requirements, as one group advances they change the requirements behind them making it harder to advance. Support staff are actively involved in decisions affecting technician pay without their own pay even being known. Techs are subject to termination if they don’t comply with certain time requirements yet support staff can blatantly disregard these with no repercussions.","Keep support staff out of any discussions that concern technician pay.

Furthermore, with the company having a very down year on the market, there has been a sharp increase in the number of layoffs in several business units which has fed into a developing culture of fear and mistrust.  

Biggest con that I can think of - last year, GE found a way to literally take a paycheck from American employees at Christmas.  The company has a bi-weekly payout schedule for your salary which means twice a year you have a month with three paychecks.  GE, in an effort to get in front of changing OT laws, decided to move the last paycheck of the year to the following week.  In affect, American employees, who tend to look at the 'third paycheck' month as a bonus of sorts, were left feeling like they were robbed.  It still leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.","GE is a great company with a lot of opportunity, but at the moment I would leave in a heartbeat if I found a similar job with a competitor.

I may cause him trouble from time to time but I'm still trying to help the few guys at the bottom that most senior executives never get the real story about. They cant go up the hall to HR because HR has been trained how to respond to every issue.","Disgusting, current employee watched company go from SUPERB AND EXCELLENT  TO DISGUSTING.  Benefits and pay were excellent in the beginning but now benefits are 10 times worse tham Obama care. And my pay is less than a third of what I made 10 years ago.
98% of all the people used to try to do what they could to help move the company forward and prosper, now it's everyone for themselves except a few warriors spread out across the company still helping the little person at the bottom to understand how the company has learned to be Hollywood actors and let one think they have input and make a difference. Also, if you have any type of role that is hard to replace, don't bother trying to transfer within the company because they will block your transfer and then lie directly to your face that they didn't. But on a lighter note, once you prove they blocked your transfer with solid evidence, they will finally admit responsibility but make clear that the way they responded the first time you asked that they did not lie to you by the wording they used.","Listen, not pretend to listen. Go out face to face and talk to your people. It may cost a little more money to do that but the bottom line will justify the money well spent. You hired great people because that's what's needed in a company to grow. Now utilize those individuals as you intended. I have worked in upper mgmt and at the bottom as a machine operator for the lowest pay, which I might add was more than I make now. I would have had more than 30 years by now and already retired but instead I'm being sold like property. Look at the company's bottom line over 30 years. Jack Welch knew exactly when to bale out because new directives and younger minds started looking for ways to cut expenses without looking at long term repercussions, because they knew that they wouldn't be there when the bottom fell out. In manufacturing, we were a training ground for college graduates. We had six month engineers every 6 months with a project costing millions and then they move on and we're stuck with junk that doesn't work anymore because they are gone and aren't still there fixing the bugs. After a couple of months and a new engineer, we usually just ripped off everything the previous engineer did and scrapped it in the warehouse in boxes. The company's bottom line over the last 30 years speaks for itself. Now the 98% of the people that used to look to try to help move the company forward or the 98% who are trying to figure out how to cut money out of the company."

I've also been incredibly lucky. 

Overall GE has great people. There really are no slackers, although you will of course come across sociopaths here and there, especially those on the fast track. Try to avoid them. Enjoyment of one's work at GE (or anywhere) can very much depend on the local team dynamic and the skill of the local leader to nurture and energize the team.

Vacation policies have improved, with Senior Professional Band and above now on permissive leave programs where one is simply allowed (with manager approval) to take the time off they need. Note that this works well when the employee is comfortable taking time off and the manager agrees with the amount of time off that the employee wants, but I fear that many younger employees may be afraid to take time off if they think it might make them look less dedicated than their peers. If you have any concerns, my suggestion is to find a mentor to coach you in this. Folks that have been around a while are well-calibrated to how much time off is reasonable.","Surviving a career at GE involves dodging a lot of bullets. While this has become somewhat normal in corporate America, GE was among the first to perfect the art of shedding large masses of people. GE makes proud claims of being a meritocracy, but most job loss events are unrelated to performance. If you are in a business that is doing well, you MIGHT be okay but even then there are too-frequent seismic shifts. Several times in my career I created amazing teams with clear purpose, uptake, and customer impact, but constant change always seemed to disrupt forward momentum short of the potential.  Of all the people I've worked with, I would say that ~80% were pushed out for one reason or another. Very few make it to natural retirement. GE still CAN be a good place to spend a few years, but is probably best viewed as a launch pad. Finally, while salaries are fine, GE's healthcare benefits are pretty bad, and retirement healthcare benefits are simply not affordable (but most won't retire from GE anyway).

Note that as of this review (August 2017) GE is in the midst of significant turmoil due to: (1) financial under-performance; (2) activist investor pressure; and (3) change in CEO. It may take a couple of years for the new CEO to get things back on track, and I suspect the process will involve substantial change.","GE has always had a bit of an arrogance about its management leadership. I believe this is a blind spot.

Location? Ability to network and a sense that once you're part of the GE family, there will always be opportunity for you here, as long as you can tolerate all of the below.","Lack of structure, guidance, and training. You are expected to be a mind reader and ""on-call"" at all times. They don't tell you during the interview that required OT involves weekends *and* holidays. In over 15 years in accounting and finance, this is the first organization that has required me to work on all major holidays. Work/life balance means we will allow you to recoup your time later, but family and friends are rarely able to wait for a week or two until you can recoup your time to take off and celebrate with them. Almost everyone in the Global Ops Center in downtown Cincinnati is new. This means that very few people really have a solid framework of information about the organization in order to make informed decisions or to inform others in their decisions. I quickly learned to not take other people at their word as most are quick to give the impression that their opinion is correct without considering that the siloed nature of information within this organization makes it nearly impossible for any one person to fundamentally know anything about which they speak if it isn't in reference to their microscopically specific responsibilities. The workspace is touted as a collaborative environment, and yet it does not lend itself well to collaboration among team members without finding a meeting space. Alternatively, there is not privacy or quiet space for thinking unless you grab a phone room. Perhaps workspaces within each group would allow for more active huddling. Functions within the same business are spread out over several different floors and spaces, where having everyone sit together in the same space would make more logical sense from a collaboration standpoint. Departments and functions feel very disjointed. ""Change is the only constant"" is a favorite phrase around the office, but the momentum of change that is occurring doesn't allow for people to adapt and become experts at anything before moving on to the next shiny system or tool meant to ""streamline"" processes...that no one has even had an opportunity to establish in the first place. ""Not your grandpa's GE"" is also another favorite phrase. While I admire progress and innovation, perhaps taking some notes from Grandpa's GE with regards to structure, guidelines and foundational organizational processes would have been beneficial instead of sending Grandpa to the nursing home and essentially writing him off. Bigger is not always better. They lure applicants in with attractive salaries only for them to find out that 60+ work weeks are the norm and the salary isn't that lucrative at all, once you do the math. Benefits are industry norm - nothing to write home about. Employees must pay for their own parking (GE discount).","There is no glory is making your people sacrifice their personal lives to come into the office on holidays and weekends. In fact, it's shameful.  Stop drinking the coolaid and realize that *you* have the power to set boundaries and guidelines that will improve the morale of your teams and ultimately the center as a whole. Until then, you will have difficulty retaining seasoned employees who have been elsewhere and know that this isn't ""just how it is"". Also, be up front with people when you interview them and let them know your work expectations. The general ""are you OK with overtime"" seems a bit misleading as anyone who has worked in accounting/finance knows that OT is fairly standard at period/quarter close and will answer yes. Instead, ask ""Are you OK working weekends and holidays when they occur during period or quarter close?"" If my interviewers and recruiters had been that forthright with the working expectations at the Global Ops Center, I never would have left my former employer that truly offered work/life balance and excellent benefits."

Interesting work. Respectable company with good management. I love GE, I love what we do, and I love what the company stands for. We're not afraid to make bold moves, and despite a heavy burden of bureaucracy, we do big, important, world-changing things. We are transforming factories and machines for the digital era by instrumenting them with sensors, connecting them to a homegrown cloud platform, and helping our partners to build transformative apps to improve their businesses based on analysis of the data ... and if that by itself weren't enough, we make trains, planes, and power plants while were at it.  So when I write this review, know that it's with a heavy heart - I always have, and still do LOVE GE, what we do, and what the company stands for, and I will do everything in my power to make sure that GE returns to not only a company that does great things, but also great place to be while getting them done.","Our cash flow on industrial operations was bad last quarter. Lay people off, oust the CEO, set aggressive targets tied to exec bonuses bad. This in itself isn't a con - businesses have cycles, industry waxes and wanes, and along the way there will be hirings and firings, business class and coach, fat raises and thin. We all understand this, and I don't begrudge the company letting people go of people to make ends meet. We all make cutbacks in our lives when times are hard, the government should do it, and corporations -have- to do it.  I don't even begrudge the board the executive bonus increases and decreases that are tied to the 2017 and 2018 1B savings targets -- targets that big have to be driven from the top down, hard decisions need to be made, and if the right decisions are made intelligently, they've earned their bonuses.  In fact, were I in Jeff Immelt's shoes with an activist investor breathing down my neck demanding my job, I'd make many of the same moves he's making. So why the 1 star review, when I love the company, understand the cuts, and agree that we need to get back to positive cashflow?

The cut the already miserly 'above and beyond' bonus program. While this in itself isn't a big deal, it signals to me that the management layers have given up on morale, engagement, and everything that goes with it. The bang-for-buck of employee activities like affinity groups (which have also had their funding cut), holiday parties, and 'thank-you' bonus programs is unmatched, and to see these things go means that not only have they made cuts with heavy hearts, they've moved to a point where they just don't care about morale among the rank-and-file anymore.

* GE could benefit by holding all managers with direct reports to the highest standard by conducting routine 360 reviews by their employees so GE can monitor and recognize good leaders and properly address poor ratings (before top talent jumps ship).

Maintenance rates are among highest in industry yet funds are diverted from individual products to fix broken products or build new products that are not provided to clients as stream of enhancement.  In regards to employees, benefits handbooks contain language that allows the company to make changes at any time or to be selective in providing benefits even for things like disability where employee thinks they bought insurance coverage.  Employees are asked to work incredible hours, there is no real time off at executive levels.  Vacation and sick time is now undefined and at Manager's discretion.

Executives may take vacations, but don't leave your phone or computer at home as you will be called and asked to work.","Executive management is filled with people who do not know the healthcare business as they have been moved from other business units in GE. GE does not want to pay the salary requirements to draw top talent, or promises big bonuses and stock options which never materialize.  Some executives are not honest with senior leadership about business growth opportunities, product development costs and timelines and profitability objectives leading to a culture of missing numbers and layoffs or reorganizations.  Ask for the truth, even if it is painful to hear and hire people who know the business at the top.  US Healthcare IT has had very high turnover at GM and above level consistently over past five years. Culture is not tolerant of people who don't say what they want to hear, \leaving a weak culture of yes men.  Too much time managing internally and not enough on running the business.

When you get a chance take 10 mins and google some of the things GE sells. Jet engines nuclear reactors automation software ultrasonic and MRI machines. These are things that unequivocally benefit people. Now google top startups and look at some of the stuff they're doing...it's probably yet another ""ground-breaking"" app that lets you deliver food or schedule grooming for your cat or dog. This feeling outwardly manifests itself in the culture where your coworkers (across all departments- engineering sales marketing) will be passionate about their work and the business. They will generally be proud of contributing to technology that can be universally appreciated and not just for one niche purpose or clique. This isn't exactly easy to find at tech companies these days (trust me?)

You're also likely to get fantastic work life balance, BUT varying from business to business since GE is so large. Managers get legit leadership training and it no doubt costs the company $$$. It is noticeable, and does have a positive effect on the perceived and actual work/life balance when your team is well-managed. The longer you stay the more likely you are to get paid training and covered travel.","the bureaucracy. Hands down. This is a BIG company. There's a saying about the left arm not knowing what the right arm is doing. GE is like an octopus where its every tentacle for itself. they've tried to fix this in recent years by being more ""lean"" but, unfortunately, it's just ingrained in the middle and upper level management to have more process rather than less. This may take decades to fix, if ever. you WILL be forced to engage in the latest and greatest organizational fad like 'Scrum' (previously Six Sigma. maybe soon to be Microservices) even if it makes absolutely no sense for the project at hand OR it is proving to be overly time consuming and ineffective. Not all sub businesses are created equal at GE and some are just way worse than others at staying ahead of the curve and not getting bogged down in endless processes. This may not be the best place for the young and brash - be prepared for moments where you simply cannot be productive because of your environment. But remember the environment does hugely depend on the particular sub businesses, like Energy, Aviation and Healthcare. Some are far better than others at being efficient.","Keep metrics for average time spent on processes (including, but not limited to, team processes like Agile, workplace training, company-wide and team meetings, yearly HR requirements and performance reviews, marketing and engineering presentations) and aim, year over year, to drive these times lower and justify their contributions to productivity when this is not possible. Reward teams for delivering promising, tangible results and not just shoddy prototypes, documentations and powerpoints. Keep engineers in direct contact with friendly and willing customers; do not silo them.

The company also has top training programs.,"The company prides itself on diversity but compensates those of color (particularly African-Americans) considerably less than their Caucasian peers. I saw this firsthand as I (an African-American), on multiple occasions, found that Caucasian peers with the same title were paid significantly more than I was.

In one instance, a former peer (who was Caucasian) disclosed his compensation to me and specifically indicated that I should not mention my knowledge of his salary to our manager as our manager knew him being paid more than me would not be well received. The peer was specifically told by our manager to not tell me what he made but eventually disclosed his salary. The peer and I shared the same title, with me having several years more experience (all with the company) and a graduate degree (the peer did not have one), and his salary was a double digit percentage higher than mine.

Additionally, as I progressed my way to multiple promotions, I was replaced on two separate occasions by employees who took my previous position (with roles and responsibilities unchanged) and given a higher title/compensation package than I was given.

The affinity forums (African-American Forum, Hispanic Forum, etc.) are used by the company to give the appearance of caring for employees of color while paying them materially less. The company has been disgraceful in many of its dealings with employees of color (Marcel Thomas, etc.).

Overall, if you are a person of color, I would strongly recommend only working at GE to obtain the necessary experience to move on to a role at a different company that will compensate you at a level commensurate with your experience.",Be more transparent regarding compensation amongst all levels and titles and guarantee equal pay for women and minorities.

Tuition reimbursement as well.  entry level pay from what I understand is competitive. Great group of people from entry level assemblers, up to leads, and facilitators. Some supervisors aren't bad people, but are mostly figureheads with no real responsibilities.","Very little upward promotions for those who started on the floor. Minor promotions with little pay increases maybe so, but nothing higher than lead type positions. Even if you get a bachelors degree.  Inexperienced supervisors and managers with no production experience, and with integrity issues run the place with incompetence.  No integrity, but back stabbing, and dishonesty by management. Supervisors/managers without integrity, or real production experience are useless, and are a waste of payroll. Hire supervisors and managers out of leads/facilitators that have earned bachelors degrees, as they will make a much more positive impact on the business, but also morale.","Change the OMLP to require 3+ years production/warehouse experience, plus Operations/Supply Chain Management degree, not engineering with the exception of industrial engineering. The OMLP graduates rarely truly understand the production environment even after they're finished, and even after years go by are still more of a liability and waste of payroll.  Same with supervisors/managers, require production experience. Without hands on production experience(doesn't have to be with the product you make, or with GE), including being a lead, they are nothing short of useless. 

Poor performing supervisors/managers with integrity issues who aren't respected by their subordinates shouldn't be promoted or moved to another equal salaried position, they should be terminated without notice, and no severance. Just like hourly employees who aren't up to par with whats expected. If 9/10 of their subordinates think they're useless, they probably are.

Require at least bi-yearly re-certification of Six Sigma, and require hands on experience in the process they are improving. Too often do they contradict Lean/Six Sigma principals. 

No more hiring recent college grads for management unless they have production experience entry level, and as a lead for 3+ years. Engineering degree is not auto-manager material, and it never will be."

Most people are in a role for two years and encouraged to move on.    Problem is they don't train the person replacing them so the new guy has to reinvent the wheel.    People are just hitting their stride at two years and are getting efficient in what they are doing.      Zero turn over from former to present employee causes disturbing ripples down the line.   We could be so much more LEAN if we could curb this.

Managers do not know how to do the job of their subordinates.","HR is way overpaid and under-effective.     Look at the salaries of our HR people and they are about 90% over the national average.    HR wields way too much influence in matters they know absolutely nothing about.     That entire organization needs to be torn down and re constructed to be a RESOURCE not managers of a technical engineering company.     They have a 360 degree review process but no one uses it.    Managers, including HR managers, should be required to have a 360 completed by every one below them, anonymously.   

Diversity is nice but putting people in roles because we have fill a certain percentage point.....it makes zero sense.     Put blinders on to where someone is from or what they look like and hire the most qualified people.    You'll be amazed at what you get.

Next,  stop allowing roles to move on at two-ish years.... At least 3 to 5 years in a role should be required.   

Stop the dotted line manager scenario....not effective.     There a lot of ex military in GE.... I don't understand how their military training doesn't spill over as far as  leadership goes.   Most managers have never held the role of the positions they lead.    How can you lead this way?   You can't effectively.     ""An effective leader knows how to do the job above them and below them.""   Look it up.

Do a better job of training sales people.    A common saying: ""customers don't know what they are buying and we don't know what we are selling"".   We can't do much about inept customers but we can certainly pair sales teams up with subject matter experts to ensure sales know their product."

I love the fitness center, extra events the company does like global community day (you volunteer for a day instead of working), family fun day where they bring in bounce house, face painters, things like that.  GE gives out freebies like LED bulbs and t-shirts frequently.  You can still get appliance discounts even though appliances was sold off.  There is no more employee buying discount on top of the friends and family pricing however.  GE also has a great rewards program where you can nominate your hard working co-workers for gifts cards or cash.","HR made some bad decisions recently. They froze all salaries for senior level employees for a minimum of 3 years (could be longer) to implement a bonus program.  They did not give you an option to opt out.  The biggest issue is the goals to get a bonus are extremely difficult and conflicting.  They've also decide ""co-location"" is important.  The problem is they didn't co locate people with who they really work closely with everyday.  They also put folks from real offices (walls, doors, windows) into cubicles that are loud and distracting.  It's a global company, so you are working with people all around the world.  You can't hear them on your conference calls with this awful setup.  

There is no such thing as work-life balance.  I've seems multiple people moved to new positions and the old positions now is responsible for two full time jobs.  I was actually given three.

Supply chain and product management get blamed any time something goes wrong even if it's not their fault.  Top management will talk about what great teams we have in meetings of 300+ people when referring to sales, but in the same breath tell them all how bad supply chain is.  Because the executive treat the team like this, all the folks working for them do the same.  It's never ending and disheartening.  The supply team is full of hard workers who make miracles happen everyday, but are rarely recognized for those efforts.","Bring back yearly salary increases.  If you want to add a bonus, no problem.  Do it on top of normal compensation.  Focus on retaining your top talent. Right now you are alienating them and they will leave.  Learn to listen. Your team knows what is best and is smart.  Do what they ask when it comes to things like office location.  Stop making decisions to help one goal metric that completely screws up another.  Stop planning only for this quarter, plan for the entire year."

GE Power & Water has been a leader in power gen products for years, and the company fights hard to stay there. They are not resting on their accomplishments though, and there are a lot of opportunities for exciting new work. At a company this size your experience will vary from location to location, program to program, manager to manager, but in general most people here are professional, courteous, and enthusiastic about their job. There is a lot of flexibility in schedules and work scope for engineers, and I haven't experienced too much micro-managing of my time.","Not everyone is working hard, and those people can get away with it because of the large nature of the organization. The end result is that others have to pick up the slack. In the worst cases, those not carrying their weight are older ""tenured"" employees who have a lot of influence, but are slowing down progress with their lazy attention to detail and mistakes. I'd assume this can happen at any very large organization, however. 

Another issue is the uncertainty of the pay structure, raises, bonuses, and promotions. There is no clear definition for when or how any of those are setup and decided. Speaking with a few people, there is a general feeling that raises and promotions are at best based on some level of favoritism, and at worst arbitrary. These forms of compensation clearly depend on how well your manager fights for you in closed-door leadership meetings, and not necessarily on performance. So depending on your manager and program, you may get promoted regularly and fairly...or you may work hard and sit in an entry level position for 8 years. But, as said, while the raises may not be well defined, base pay seems to be in line with the industry and the area.","Be more transparent about compensation structure. Do not let a person sit in an entry level position for 7+ years without promoting them or significantly recognizing them. Not only does it discourage that person, seeing it also discourages the rest of us who worry about uncertain raises. In the long run, if people aren't worth promoting after 3-4 years, they should be ""strongly encouraged"" to change job functions or just outright fired."

Employees are generally highly skilled, super intelligent and passionate about their work. Many of them are extremely helpful and kind towards new employees, it's an old boy network in many of the plants, but if that can be dealt with, they are super courteous, caring and friendly. Some upper management can be quite supportive, fair and kind. Benefits are about average for a US corporation, these days. Projects can be very interesting or not. There is a vast amount of online courses and knowledge sharing events, that are interesting and helpful for personal growth. The GE intranet is informative and insightful. There is some leeway for hourly employees, to dress extremely casual and as they please, within reason. Smoking has been eliminated from all the GE campuses, which is really nice. Some GE sites have onsite cafeterias, the food is marginal to really great, depends on the location. The cafeteria prices are pretty reasonable, still. The GE newsletters arrive pretty often and they have some good information, as well. The corporate plants are cleaned inside on a regular basis and the rest rooms, are quite clean, overall. Computers et al, are generally in good working order, although sometimes there is a long wait to get a working phone or pc, on one's desk as a new employee. Some GE plants have a onsite Health Clinic, which is staffed with medical personnel, also a nice feature. GE, as a corporation offers a Philanthropic Matching Gifts program, which is of great benefit to the philanthropic minded employee and for the associated charities. Matching gifts has a limit of 50k donation, per employee/annually. Very nice program! The staff who manage this program are super courteous and helpful. Overall, it's pretty fair in many ways. In-plant, secured parking is found at many GE campuses, which is nice as well. GE also provides additional outside corporate discounts, (i.e., Verizon, Apple, Moissonite  products, etc.), which are also nice to use if one is inclined, to do so.","Challenges include very little work/life balance. Salaries are great coming in as a new employee, but then drop off within a year or two. Some of the work can be really boring and unchallenging. There is little connection or communication between upper management and the lower level staff. Hourly employees are not well respected or treated fairly, in many instances. In some GE plants, bullying and employee to employee harassment is overlooked and ignored. Then, in other plants, this type of juvenile atmosphere is NOT tolerated at all. Time Management demands are very high, meetings are overbooked and many are really a waste of time. Manager to employee, favoritism abounds in some GE plants and not in others. Many of the upper management employees portray themselves as honest and caring, when they are not, which can be hard to deal with. HR, is of little help when there is discord between employees. Nepotism, is common in some of the smaller GE plants. The HSA/FSA Health programs are very difficult to navigate, when GE was using BOA ( Bank of America) it was disastrous, just awful customer service and no real GE support or backing. The employees pretty much had to fend for themselves, with BOA. Leaving for vacations and time off can be challenging, since the level of employees and amount of employees has been so cut back, there are more and more demands on the current employees. Meeting attendance is often mandatory, with little regard for anything else, but the meeting attendance. Intra-plant philanthropy is expected. Participation in onsite ""feel good"" events is mandatory, health fairs, job fairs, etc. Smoking is NOT allowed, which can be a down side for smokers, although I think it's great! The respect level from upper management to lower management is almost non-existent. The ""all for one"" mentality is often hard to deal with, especially when it is mainly for the good of the CEO and the Board members. Little concern is spent on the hourly employees, overall. Back door agreements between managers prevail, at many GE sites. There can be a high level of infighting between management and lower employees, who just want to get their work done on time. There is a heavy level of regard placed on metrics. GE does metrics, all day, every day on everything. The cost of this, the cost of that, the cost of something else and in 10 different ways. Yet, the metrics are often disregarded if they do not pan out or demonstrate what has already been assumed by upper level management. GE is a highly time based organization, with a 1950's old boy network style of management, where nepotism and favorites often prevail. The implied ethics mentality also prevails, GE states over and over ""That it is always the biggest Gorilla, in the room"" and it can have its way, at all cost. This can be hard to swallow at times, especially when the employees have ethics pushed down their throats on a regular basis. Upper management often uses ethics as they see fit, and will bend the rules to their sway and advantages if necessary.","Take a hard look at this once great corporation and bring it back on track. I wanted to work for GE ever since I was a little child, at the NY World's Fair and I achieved that goal. When I began at GE, I was so happy and proud to be there, but as time went on, the ""bubble faded from the wine"", and pretty quickly for me. I felt let down and disheartened, by the nepotism and the goings on at various GE plants. I felt that GE cared more about the bottom line than anything else. I saw cruelty perpetrated from employee to employee and from contractor to employee, with little control from HR or from the ethics committee. Many instances, employees (especially hourly) were treated really badly and no one said anything or made it stop. Employees, need and want respect, they work really hard and many put their whole hearts into their jobs, and that should be honoured and respected and it is not. The choosing of favourite employees over another is unfair and quite hurtful. I lost my own GE job, because of gossip, rumours directed at me and because of nepotism. HR was of little help to me, when I was in trouble due to rumours and gossip from an employee's contractor wife, it was a terrible experience and a terrible situation, where I had little recourse, but to leave. That was really painful to have worked so hard and so long for GE only to be tossed aside like an old rag, when the chips were down."

But there are other good benefits - like a pension, plenty of Sick, Vacation, Personal and paid vacation time, and flexibility when needed - at least in the GE business where I am.","GE loves to reorganize - It has been 8 years since the acquisition and I have seen 5 reorgs in my business.  Reorgs are unsettling for staff, and every time a new leader is introduced, they reorg us to their liking.  There has also always been a sense that senior leadership is disconnected and really doesn't even know what they are reorging.  Leaders move around from GE business to GE business every few years.  Also, it is difficult to move up in the company past a certain point.  It seems you have to start out of college in one of the programs, and/or join the Corporate Audit staff, to gain the visibility needed to move up.  That can be frustrating for people who joined from an acquisition, and who bought into the GE culture and message very early on.  The other thing which tends to add to staff morale issues is how frequently we are pushed to do more with less.  Teams are combined and peoples jobs are more than doubled, with no salary increases, meager merit increases, and little acknowledgement.  It's demotivating.","Employee engagement and recognition is huge.  It's not enough to get on an All-Hands call and tell everyone thanks.  And it's worse to get on an All-Hands call and repeatedly praise the same people, frequently sales people, without praising or recognizing the staff that actually keeps your day to day business running.  Of course new sales are to be commended, but the work that staff does every day to keep current customer happy and loyal is just as important.  The sales cycle can be very long - so repeat revenue from existing customers is also very important.  Also, compensate your staff.  And when there is a huge disparity between peers, make a salary adjustment to get people's salaries in line.  When someone stays with a company for a long time they are often paid less than someone new being hired into the position.  What does it say to people who have had loyalty and dedication to a company when a peer leaves the company and comes back 2 years later making much more.

But that's not correct.","In the past few years, the culture at GE Appliances in Louisville has changed from one where employees truly believed that if they worked hard and did right by the company, the company would do right by them, to one where we feel like we are being actively being mislead by management.  

New cost cutting measures are launched  so often it is hard to keep up with them, and each reduction makes the job a harder by adding a burden or removing a benefit from employees and customers.  These changes are always announced with happy talk and pitched as improvements, in the form of easy to read elevator speeches that seem obviously written by a PR company.

Rather than call it what it is - when something is taken from you, it is a reduction in services, quality, benefits, and value.  So why can't they just stop sugar coating everything and acting like we are stupid.  

In the past week, GE and Electrolux jointly announced that GE was in talks with Electrolux to purchase our beloved appliance division, lock stock and barrel with Appliance Park Kentucky.   Even that announcement was written to dance around the truth, the announcement claimed that nothing was certain and the two companies were only involved in casual discussions, when the opposite is true.  

So now all the cost cutting and happy talk of the past few years makes sense:  we've been running on bubble gum and rubber bands to lower expenses so GE Appliances would be worth more.  With that spin removed, any fifth grader can see the truth of this situation:  what will happens next is that our loyal workers, most with more than a decade of service, will get flushed into an uncertain and dismal future just so that stockholders, who own stock in GE but not in the GE Appliance division, can make a few bucks while all this is going down and GE is continuing to apply ""MADE IN AMERICA""  logos to all the appliances rolling out of Appliance Park, Kentucky.  

This division of  GE is the company that Thomas Edison formed in 1890, and Jeff Immelt is selling it to a company from Sweden that makes low quality appliances with bad service records.  They want to buy GE Appliances to fix their own problems.  But it never works like that, ask yourself where Maytag is after it was purchased by Whirlpool.  They still make a few Maytag appliances, but it is a shadow of what it used to be.  

My advice to job seekers:  Unless you are coming for a few months for an internship, I think you'd be crazy to come here now.  I probably don't need to tell you what happens when two companies are combined into one - but i'll give you a hint:  layoffs.","When you look back on your life, I hope you are able to forgive yourself and find peace for what will happen to the Louisville economy after Electrolux buys GE Appliances.  This is an American tragedy in the making.  And if you are in management and you didn't actively participate in the sale, instead you just stood by, you are equally responsible for failing to lift a finger to prevent harm to good people who trusted you and this company.  But I can no longer stomach this, so you'll have to eat this sin without me."

GE Capital, Commercial Finance, former VFS (Vendor Financial Services), etc. Others, not so much. I was fortunate that Jack Welch was CEO for approx.  67% of my career with GE. Throughout this era employees BELIEVED in GE Values, embraced fantastic training tools such as Six Sigma, CAP (Change Acceleration Process), Leadership Training. Customer Satisfaction (referring to internal customers..GE Employees who engaged IT Client Services for support) was top priority. Employees/Teams worked in the office..together..engaged everyday with various teams. I loved getting up in the morning and going to work. Goals and Objectives were established during the first quarter of every year based on solid data. Projects/Tasks made sense. If an employee was a top performer there was no doubt she/he was on a solid, very timely career path.  to be continued below.","Then Mr. Welch left. All GE Capital IT employees were transferred to a centralized IT department under GE Corporate for phase one of the OneGE initiative. A centralized IT group serving all GE Verticals. Only a select one or two small GE divisions (small in regards to number of employees, but extremely integral to GE as a whole), Sigal Zarmi, one of the few female CIO's in Corporate America had the vision and foresight and COURAGE to push back. While the rest of GE IT..now Corporate IT..disintegrated quite rapidly with multiple cost cutting initiatives, outsourcing, so many re-orgs and name changes, team changes..impossible to keep count.  Morale of the majority of IT personal desperately treaded water but couldn't hold out. It began sinking and continues to sink to this very day. GE Values mean nothing, Spirit letter means nothing. 

Don't take my word for it..survey Corporate IT employees. Give them the following list of GE Core Values that drive Leadership and employees to excel.

*Strong Work Ethic: Valued employees who work hard and work smart
*Dependable/Reliable: Take Accountability for the teams they lead or projects they manage
*Positive Attitude and Embracing Change
*Adaptable and Flexible: Projects don't always go as planned. Adapt, think outside of the box, and motivate your team.
Ask them to rate them in order of importance. Also give them an option to rate ALL of them as EQUALLY IMPORTANT.

Now lets make a charitable David vs Goliath bet.  Me v.s. Glassdoor.  $5000 donated to the charity of choice. I will wager that over 94% will select the option that All of them are equally important.  It does not matter how many employees actually rate them. My wager? Less than 6% will reply back that the values listed are important but are NOT the GE CORE Values that are critical to the growth and success of General Electric

The real GE Values which truly ARE critical when INDIVIDUAL Goals and Objectives are identified in a one one one meeting with a manger. They are the following:
External focus
Show imagination and courage
Drive inclusiveness, 
Have expertise 
Clear thinkers

Most teams are virtual, in silos, have no idea what related teams are doing. The teams that were outsourced work in sweat shop environments. They are treated as lepers, beaten with a stick, not embraced as teammates. In my last months at GE, after engaging HR and the Ombudsperson because my boss was a bully, a former Army vet who treated employees as if they were in the Army at boot camp, not part of a team. Sticking up for the team who STRONGLY advised me NOT to go to HR as it is the kiss of death and told me flat out they would plead the fifth if approached. They all advised me to shut up, collect the paycheck, pay the bills, and be grateful I have a job.  I couldn't do that. I dreaded going to work each day. I was depressed..desperately searched for another job at GE and FOUND a perfect fit.
But it was AFTER I went to HR. I was not allowed to move. I was put on a performance plan.
When I was informed by my boss that I was being put on a performance plan (even though I achieved ALL my Goals and Objectives along with additional stretch goals) I explained that I needed a change after working for 4 years on a team that was constantly in flux, no stability, four managers in four years...my manager informed me that I COULD interview for the position, saw no reason why I couldn't move but he wanted to discuss it with HR first. End result, I was NOT allowed to interview..was put on a plan. 

The rest is history. I could literally write a book about Corporate IT. It would be incredibly entertaining. Solidly backup my claims with data. The scandal stories alone would make it a best seller.  I decided not too because I am grateful for the fantastic managers I had in my early years. Grateful for the wide skill set I developed in those early years. And my last 4 or 5 years? I was schooled with 500+ examples of how NOT to lead, manage projects, treat people.","For GE Corporate I have none. Every year we were surveyed, every year survey data spelled out (make some serious changes) and nothing ever changed. The advice I would give would endorse (x, y, z) and that goes against Glassdoor Rules."

Therefore <10% people end-up in executive ranks. Functionally, those in Sales or Finance are valued the most. The rest end up being worker bees for their lives.","Very intrinsically focused for a company that has better than average products. GE is good at acquiring businesses that have good products. However, GE is weak in Product Management. As a result, there is little improvement on products over next 5-10years even though a huge amount is spent on product development.

They can take months of vacation time. Go play golf with their other manager friends.  Play ""angry birds"" at their desk during work time. BUT if you want to take 1-2 days off they question you.  OR they tell you that ""now is not the best time to take 1 day off""  ... unbelievable!!!! 

2- Again, managers DO NOT care about their employees. Whether something has been done properly or not does not matter to them. Whether their employees are happy or not does not matter to them.  They take credit off of your every accomplishment as if they have anything to do with it, but when something goes wrong, they will burn you at the stake. They just want to get promoted and have big fat raises to their salaries.  

3- When upper management make mistakes, workers, and engineers pay the price! As an engineer, my job is to build the engine as good as I can. As a manager your job is to find a customer for this engine.  IF as a manager you can not find a customer, THEN it is your fault. Please resign your position to someone more competent.  But nooooo ... those who are at the bottom of the packing order pay the price of the poor management. 

4-It is a good company if you want to get a job straight out of college with bachelors degree. If you have a masters or phd, DO NOT even bother, your education or experience will not be valued at all ... you will take orders from someone who does not even know the science behind how things work inside the engine just because that person has been in the company more than you do. 

5- There is too much bureaucracy!  in order to get one simple task done, you have to fight with numerous people.  

6- If you are planning to come here to work, you'd better be good at kissing a lot of a$$, agreeing with everything that your seniors tell you, or you will not get any raise/promotion any time soon.

7- The company is located in a VERY conservative area, and most of the employees are also very conservative and biased towards those come to the company outside the south (especially north east or the west). 

8 - Check the stock values, since 2008 stock values of GE's competitors went back to their original value. Yet, GE is still half price.  Obviously something is not going right.  Instead of replacing those who put the company at it's current position, they are laying people off ... sure!!! lay people off ... then waste money and hire clueless new graduates ... train them ... waste money ... then lay them off to cover your mistakes ...  :)  

9- benefits?  what is that mean?  you will get the cheapest health insurance out there ... you will have to work on national holidays ... you will get the worst retirement benefits too ... GE cuts from its employees, so it can offer a sweet retirement to upper management ... i.e. check John Krenicki's retirement deal ... what did he do to deserve such a sweet deal?  Did he invent the gas turbine? 

10- The corporation made $14 billion dollar profit last year, but did not pay taxes ... what is the deal? why? I pay my taxes ... 

11-I finally had enough and applied for positions in GE's competitors. Currently I work for a competitor in Jupiter Florida, and get paid $15K more  :)  I have better health and retirement benefits.  I am not sure how many employees have to leave GE for upper management to realize that they have to treat their employees with a little more respect.

They maintain a amazing company educational cours4e library of several thousand personal. technical. and up to date business courses free for employees. And still offer tuition reimbursement incentives for educational facilities you may enroll in locally.. (Colleges, tech schools, etc)

There is an annual program for the performance review process that is basically making you keep your resume up to date, and the emphasis is to use the  new ""buzz words"" corporate feels is right for the times - after you take an in house class about them..

Their retirement plan is incredible,  and remains the best I have ever seen for a big business, especially as so many other places phased them out. the heart of it is 100% company funded!

I was in a target department during a RIF that was unfortunate to be involved in, but I also feel it was a wise bjusin3ess decision!

Even 30 Rock is a reflection of GE conglomerate day to day issues - but with a bit too much embellishment!

Of course, they are well compensated for their stress and most stay loyal for their entire career, so is this really a con?  I would return in a heartbeat!","To management I can only recommend weeding out the active ""yes men""! Don't fire them, just get back to basics on their own merits! Many of their predecessors have been guilty of this for over half a century, but I feel GE would be much stronger as a business in these troubled times, with the workforce becoming more loyal and projective as a result!

Benefits are average.  Health plan was really good but now average due to high-deductible plan.  Vacation plan is on par, was above average but reduced to par a few years ago.  Pension plan is very good, but I suspect will be brought down to par in the next few years.  Actual work time ('casual overtime') is on par, but could vary widely depending on what projects are involved with.  Fairly easy to change job positions if want to completely leave current role, but may become more difficult to improve pay or position within existing organization.  Job security is generally good.  Cooperative with personal time-off type issues.","Poor leadership.  I know that GE was known for great leadership, but those days are currently gone.  There is a lack of long term vision of where want products to go, what customers want to serve, and how to get there.  Long term projects struggle for years with little leadership engagement, and then leaders become surprised when crunch time comes and deadlines are missed.  There is a lack of communication between leaders of different organizations, locations, etc.  Professional confrontation that is sometimes required to resolve an issue is always pushed down to the engineer level for resolution, leaders are terrified to (professionally) confront another leader for fear of bad labels... in other words, there is a big incentive to keep things swept under the carpet.

Incredible amount of bureaucracy.  Simple tasks that used to take an educated decision by a few smart engineers with some involvement of some more senior engineers now require multiple levels of managers, consulting engineers, chief engineers, technical leaders, etc.  Chief engineers have a very confrontational tone as well as have difficultly in accepting new ideas but at the same relentlessly push their new ideas even though not completely thought through.

PowerPoint culture.  Inordinate amount of time spent in PowerPoint.  In theory the idea is that the PowerPoint slides summarize your work in order to communicate progress, risks, etc.  Instead, all of the good engineering work that was done has to be force fit into a presentation tool so that the disengaged leadership chain and levels of bureaucracy can try to understand the basic concepts of what is going on.  If you are good at PowerPoint you can go far in GE, but if you want to continue to sharpen your engineering skills you will otherwise find that they will become rusty mostly due to this.

Difficult to get through to real customers.  If you had previous industry experience, will likely be more comfortable in ability to make decisions, understand what is going on, and push for what you think is right for customers.  Otherwise, customer's needs are filtered and passed down through multiple layers, ultimately leading to lowered customer expectations.  Additionally, a culture has developed amongst those with less direct industry and customer experience, where they have become leaders that are setting direction for product offerings, design decisions, etc but clearly are missing the mark.  This in turn also leads to the previous comment of rusty engineering skills, where the rank-and-file become out of touch with industry standards, customer expectations, etc.  Additionally, things such as attending a conference or sitting on an industry standards board are reserved for a select few.

Lack of team mentality.  This is something simply have to accept in a 'meritocracy' such as GE.  You are constantly conscious of your yearly EMS (yearly personnel review process), where more or less have to create a resume of accomplishments every year.  On the surface it makes sense to put down your accomplishments to refresh the minds of those who determine pay raises, but it is clear that once it goes up one or two layers in the chain of command that any great individual or team efforts become less significant in lieu of name recognition.

Hopefully didn't come across as too negative.  In general probably on par with other large corporations.  However, currently falling behind our competition, leadership is currently on a down-slide, but as in everything in GE this can go in cycles and has the ability to improve if becomes a recognized problem.","- EMS yearly personnel review process has its faults, but I am not surprised by my job security or near term future standing, so please keep it moving forward.
- Continue to be cooperative with personal issues.  Although I have rarely missed time, I fully believe and appreciate that GE would be cooperative if an urgent issue arose.
- Become involved with outside customers, become involved with projects, make decisions, challenge leaders of other organizations and businesses.  Currently are obviously absent, which is greatly hurting a number of projects.
- Recognize that rank-and-file needs you to be involved to make hard decisions, not just 'engaged' in process.  Pushing all of the decision making process down to rank-and-file is leading to easy answers and sub-par products, that is also not going to improve by 'pushing' or 'challenging' the lower levels any further.
- Reconsider the levels of bureaucracy such as business leaders, technical leaders, chief engineers, consulting engineers, principle engineers, etc.  This seems to go up and down over the years, one project 'miss' often spurs a bunch of new teams, leaders, and reviewers, but ultimately this makes the project cost more and take longer with little actual reduction in risk.
- Develop a long-term strategy.  Projects that try to boil the ocean are bound to fail.  Incremental steps that lead through a long-term plan is where our competition is beating us.  Leaders need to be held accountable to a long-term strategy, not just S2 (yearly project budgeting) pushed up from bottom.  It is clear that the boil-the-ocean projects are a reaction to lack of ability to execute in more than one step."

HR presently dominates this company in a way no one truly understands and this may be why we are in such a state of array where personal relationships are more powerful than a persons capabilities. HR has eliminated the Candor that historically personified GE's culture. Specifically, HR eliminated the meaningful employee survey that allowed for employee feedback and replaced it with a useless set of guided multiple choice questions which prevent employees from discussing the topics that actually matter. Reinstitute a meaningful survey to give a voice back to our employees.. it may be tough to read by the Sr leadership but it's what's needed to get the hearts and minds of the employees  back. Also, HR should henceforth never be allowed to be featured in a glitzy Business Week cover stories to share their view of the world.. as unfortunately their view it is wrong headed and self aggrandizing.

Most the work involved managing a project to some degree, which is useful experience.  For their Edison engineers, they offered a strong training program that included leadership workshops through corporate.  Most employees seemed to care about the job they did.  That being said, most do the 8-5 routine.","Red tape and uncertainty of what the future will hold about sums up the cons.  Given that GE is a large company, it can be very challenging to get things done in a timely because of all the paperwork and approvals required to make a change to anything.  I worked at GE Consumer and Industrial and at the time corporate announced C&I would be up for sale.  When corporate couldn't get a good offer for the business, they decided to spin it off.  After I left, I believe they decided to keep the company until the economy turned so they could sell it for me.  Rumors of a sale of C&I have been around for years and won't be be gone until a sale does happen.  

It seemed like much of the engineering work was being outsourced to India.  Almost all of the CAD work is done in India.  They also have a program that brings engineers to India for rotations.  I certainly got the feeling that company was in the process of handing over much of the engineering work to India.  Since there are alot of engineers in India willing to work for a lot less than an American engineer I would expect this trend to continue",Management within the C&I business was fine.  Most of the issues are a result of the actions by corporate.  Management seems to care and is approachable.

GE Energy is a stable company.","You get the large, impersonal corporate atmosphere.  The interns are hired by Human Resources for one reason: to be a pipeline for the development programs.

You will probably be stuck with the boring work nobody else has the time to do.  If you are interested in a direct hire position in this economic situation, forget it.  There is no incentive to improve the intern program because most of the interns will not be hired for full-time positions.  

Management that is several pay bands above you calls the shots.  For the technical engineer, there is little room for creativity.  It is hard to quantify job performance in technical engineering roles as compared with manufacturing roles.  GE is resistant to change as seen in some analysis tools used that are decades old.  Many engineers are unhappy with their assignments and are overworked.  They stick around because they are married and GE provides a stable job.

In addition to the lack of training and work-life balance, employees of GE are typically paid less than their counterparts at major competitors.

Further, as a globally recognizable brand, being at GE allows you the professional flexibility to expand your workscope into one of many industries and across many companies -- after working at GE -- if you so choose. Beyond the name recognition, if you choose to stay in-company, the large conglomeration of businesses under GE Corporate allows you to have many different career opportunites while staying within the same umbrella. This i turn lends itself towards benefits such as being able to literally travel the world and work at various sites, within GE.","First and foremost, GE as a company likes to get the most work out of its employees that it can for the amount they pay you. This means two things: first, it means that you may be required to work incredibly long hours -- including nights and weekends -- to get the job done. It also means that your pay probably isn't going to be competitively comprable to colleagues in other companies. This is the payoff you choose when you enter one of the largest companies in the world. 
Another issue is that GE is at best inconsistent about employee recognition for hardwork and innovation: This is contrary to the stateed culture and purported focus of managers. I have seen numerous instances where managers have blatently overlooked great projects done by colleagues -- in one instance, the CFO of my division neglected a large cost-savings project because the project corrected a problem the CFO had originally created earlier in the year, and the officer didn't want a spotlight on a problem that was his fault.","First, be more inclusive in your decision-making. There are a lot of smart people at GE, including in non-management positions. While it is important to keep decision-making within the relatively higher echelons of the organization, it is also important to have variegated perspectives before going forward on major shifts in policy or structure.
Second, completey revamp your employee recognition systems: they are at best erratic, at worst a tool of leaders' personal leverage. Certain accomplishments require certain recognition, period. Try to create and regularize thresholds of achievement and corresponding compensation for work done. Third, get off the now-antiquated mentality that younger employees are going to work in similar roles for 30 years; yeah, some will, which is largely why GE doesn't recruit from Ivy Leauge schools (they don't want incredibly ambitious free-thinkers, but instead smart, detail-oriented zombies). Get your head out of the past and start offereing incentives that appeal to and keep around creative, motivated workers of the future.

Benefits - Healthcare benefits are great.  Even though you make contributions depending on the plan chosen, these are minimal when put into the context of healthcare costs today.  They also offer FSAs, 401K matching (50% up to 7% contribution) and discounts at major retailers and service companies.

Career Growth - GE offers a wide array of opportunities.  With the right amount of networking and connections you may be able to land the specific role you might be looking for.  Depending upon the function you might get more/less management visibility.  At the end of the day any GE experience will look great on your resume and have potential employers drooling over your ""great"" business management experience/exposure.

Culture - GE lives and breathes integrity.  I work in finance and can honestly say that in 8yrs I never saw an integrity violation.  Not to say there were any attempts at it but they were always identified and dealt with.","Culture – The Company is engineering driven.  If you are not an engineer you are considered a “backroom function”.  You do not have an equal sit at the table when it comes to big decisions unless you are with a group of your own (i.e. Finance with Finance, Sales with Sales, etc…).  It’s a very intense environment where nothing really gets accomplished.  Informatin systems are just as legacy as the business mentality.  In an HQ role you will probably push PowerPoint presentations back and forth for 6 months not really influencing the underlying information (it’s usually the same data with different cuts) but definitely making sure you appear to do so.  We used to call this sort of science… “the art of chartology”.   The Energy business is very bureocratic, slow, un-innovative and there is a huge disconnect between the HQ ivory tower and what really goes on in the field.

GE promotes the fact that you “own your career”… and you do.  If you want to progress within the company ranks it comes down to how well you are able to build and use your network.  “What about working hard and delivering?” you may ask.  To that I would say “Never mind that!  Focus on building your network, developing your delegation skills, having an elevator speech and identifying the right people to hang around… if there is time left crunch some numbers and send some emails” 

Business are reorganized on an annual basis.  The main reason usually is to hide nasty losses and performance under the rug of a better performing unit.

Growth/Promotions – 95% of the elements needed for promotion are the standard ones when it comes to big bureaucratic organizations.  Some of these elements are making sure you save “face”, be a master chartologist, know the right people (and kiss the right ass) and appearing to be a “doer” when you think you already are just to name a few.  Salary increases are not significant (1-3% every 18mths) unless you change jobs and negotiate your pay in a stellar way.  

GE summarizes the qualities of a great leader into what they call the “4 Es”.  Energy, Energize, Execution and Edge.  In theory they look great but in practice they are a disaster.  Most of the managers think that practicing Energy/Energize is intimidating the teams to do what needs to get done.  When it comes to having “edge” its very well known that it translates to “being an ass”.  Don’t take me wrong, I have seen people practice all of them flawlessly and be excellent leaders… but it’s by no means the norm around here.","Drive more innovation (put your money where your mouth is).  Streamline new product introduction processes by listening more to the people down in the ground.  Re-evaluate your promotion practices remembering that you are setting the tone for the rest of the organization.  Learn to reward your middle management (not necessarily has to be with money…) after all they are the ones doing the work for you.  Be honest with your workforce… you won’t appear to be weak at all and will really connect with the masses.

These risk opportunities are successful because, thanks to all of the training, every risk opportunity must have a full and easily executable mitigation plan.  And finally, I've get to meet an inept senior manager.  While I might not agree with their philosophy or a specific action, they are always well thought out and with positive intent.","The downsides are exceptionally long hours and relatively low pay.  The GE risk/reward culture drives the long hours as well as relatively untenured employees having ""bigger jobs"" than they would at other companies.  This means that their average pay is lower than those with the same role in other companies, but in those other companies it would have taken them longer to be allowed to perform the same duties.","I would tell the Senior Managers that three pre-meetings for the pre-meeting with the VP is excessive, particularly is an 80 page powerpoint deck is required for each."

You will not come away from this job with a narrow scope of expertise. 

Also, Energy is broad and deep in scope.  From gas, wind and steam turbines to nuclear, coal and diesel generators, the possibilities for different careers are many. 

Security is also a strong appeal.  Energy demand is something that may change forms but will never truly disappear.  Few industries offer the same long-term job security.","The processes of the company are many.  They are often burdensome, blind, and out of touch with reality.  However, this is not unlike other companies of this size.  Red tape is a nuisance to deal with, but it also can be a strong guide to keep things moving when the way ahead isn't clear.  

HR operates like a black box, perhaps a broken black box, and despite the heaps of fluffy, feel-good gibberish it spits out in your daily email, it's actually pretty clueless as to it's own hypocrisy and functions as a propaganda machine.  

Raises are suppressed through a convoluted system of ratings amongst peers, standing in view of the industry average, time with the company, background, and lastly, performance.  It does not pay to perform.  A set pool of money is pre-determined and the lower management is burdened with ranking their direct reports against each other to decide who gets 3% vs 4% or 5%.  Naturally, it pays to be a favorite like any other system governed by humans, but overall, it's very difficult for them to play favorites due to the way the system is setup.  In short, hire in at the highest rate you can negotiate, be prepared for raise cycles ranging from 14-18 months (and sometimes longer) and try to move to another role every 2 years to prevent your salary from losing in the race with inflation. 

It is very difficult to ever actually get anything done due to the massive amount of people that have a say in any major decision.   Some parts of the business (MPE) can hold a project up for over 6 months while it's waiting in their queue.   Major changes happen very slowly and individual contributors very seldom have any real communication or relationship with their managers.","Attrition will continue to be a huge problem for GE Energy unless the young talent base is nurtured in their skills, rewarded  based on effort and performance without ridiculous processes, and given the ability to use their talents to do real work that coincides with real life.

Some are the foremost experts in their fields and it is great to work with and learn from  extremely knowledgeable people. GE is an excellent place for women to work.  This may be due to the fact that management is somewhat traditional, but it seems flexible work arrangements are considered and awarded to women more frequently.  GE has a very strong volunteer group that does a lot of community service in the Upstate of South Carolina. For example, GE is a primary sponsor of Hands On Greenville and employee participation usually is on the order of several hundred employees. Lastly, Greenville is great location, it is not too large but large enough to bring in diverse performances and cultural events.","The average work week at GE is greater then 40 hours.  ""Casual"" overtime is often expected and usually puts people work week between 50 to 60 hours.  
For regular employees GE has an extremely poor compensation plan.  Top performers get ~5% raises on ~16 month interval. The majority of employees get 2 to 4% raises on a cycle greater then 16 months.
Flexible Work Arrangements are not a ""true"" option.  There is way too much opportunity for losses in productivity due to the informal ""casual"" overtime policy.
Manufacturing engineering and design engineering have a poor relationship, so much so that manufacturing will not share office space with design.  This causes a lack of space for the design employees, so often times six people are squeezed into a four cube area. 
Attrition seems to be getting worse and the quality of new employees is not as good as in the past.  I believe lack of talent is driven by a desire to rapidly grow so a strategy of quantity over quality was employed.  The attrition and lack of talent causes additional problems, employees usually split time trying to train the new people but often see the good ones leave in a year or two, while the ones lacking skill stick around taking a long time getting up to speed.
Over the past couple of years GE has started reducing benefits for regular workers.  Two good examples of this are a 20% increase in heath insurance and 33% increase in medical copays.
GE relies very heavily on ""outsourcing"" and feels it is the future of the company, even though the quality of work is often poor.
Human resources are completely incompetent and I am not actually sure what value they bring GE.","Check your egos at the door because the sum of GE is greater then the parts.  Work hard to identify talent and do what you need to retain it.  Please reconsider your ""unofficial"" position of Flexible Work Arrangements and make them available to all the employees.

We've lost alot of personnel over lack of pay. GE also does not give out any type of bonus compensation. This is another reason we've experienced such a large turnover in the last 12 months. Most other power plants have a bonus program as well as pay more. Another problem GE faces is they have gotten so big and have become so diverse they have actually over-complicated the most simplest of tasks. Too uch micro-managing. This tends to leave one wondering at the end of the day just what exactly did get accomplished.,"Pay more ""per hour"" wages to hourly employees, as well as more annual salaries to salaried staff. Start offering bonus incentives to hourly personnel. Increase employer contributions to 401K (current rate is 50 cents on the dollar up to 3.5% if you put in atleast 7%). Simplify and streamline processes. Quit creating programs on how to create programs (So to speak)"

There's a certain credibility that comes from working for the company - in large part, because employers can be reasonably sure of your capabilities.  For example, if you were in one of the 'program' jobs, such as IMLP or FMP, there's a cadre of people who have completed the same program that gives a benchmark for your performance.  It's like attending an Ivy League school vs. State U. ... Ivy League is known everywhere, but State U. is less well-known except in the geographic region. If you want to see the world, Join GE.  
The old adage about moving around has really been replaced; there's more emphasis on learning & mastering the job now, instead of learning every job in the company by relocation/reassigning you every 12-18 months.  That's a huge improvement.","Given the flat organization structure, you can be a the same level for many years. You'll get pay increases, but not necessarily a title change.  Their performance review process is too rigorous - there's just no getting around the ""bottom 5%"" situation with them. If you're graded as ""least effective"", you should get back in the job market, fast.
You're expected to stay in a role for 18-24 months, and that is rigorously enforced. Even if you're the best candidate for an opening, if you haven't hit that milestone, you can forget about changing jobs.  (Caveat - unless you're considered"" Top Talent"" in the annual Performance Management derby).
Annual reviews are done, and a huge amount of time goes into this - almost bringing other work to a halt.  However, your pay increases aren't necessarily annual - for Top Talent, it is 12 months, if you're considered ""Highly Valued"" - the middle 85% or so of employees, it is between 15-20 months.  If you're ""Least Effective"" there is no raise.
GE provides great benefits, but the tradeoff is that you will work very, very hard and very long hours.  Have a kid, plan to be back on line within days, even if you are taking maternity leave.  There's not a lot of empathy about dealing with family matters.  The expectation is that you are available 24/7, even in non-customer-facing roles.","Drop that stupid rule about getting rid of the bottom 5% each year.  You create unnessary churn in the workforce - if you're going to insist people stay in a job for 18-24 months before changing their role, then you should give a person the same length of time to improve performance.

I worked for small companies prior to my time with GE and I feel that the GE name on my resume gives more weight to my credentials than if I only had small company experience on there.  GE is internationally recognized and will definitely garner you respect if you have it on your resume.

If you are lucky enough to get into one - the leadership training programs hold some weight on your resume as well. This would also include things such as green belt (six sigma training), various leadership classes, and general GE inclusiveness across their business units while being geographically disperse.  So you might get a lot of experience handling multi-national teams (which is great experience in todays world), and you might get the experience of traveling to those locations.

GE paid for 75% of my masters degree, and I was very pleased with the 100% tuition reimbursement program they offer.  

In only working here for a few years, I have seen a number of people move about within GE, across businesses. This is not to say that people didn't get promoted within my own business, but the GE touch across varioius business units seems to be working well - if you want to move somewhere and there is a job opening, the way is pretty much open to you.  You can manage your career very actively, and apply to varioius job openings both within, and outside of your division - and there is no heartache if you leave for a different opportunity.  After all, it is all GE.","GE is a behemouth.  I work for a small division of a larger division, that itself is packaged into an even larger division.  It is very tough sometimes to understand this corporate vision, see it and hear it and then apply it to your day to day job.  And then you see press releases come out about your company that you were not aware of.  It is the nature of a large company that is so fragmented across so many markets - it is a virtue of the company you work for, and good or bad you will see it as an employee.

A lot of GE leadership is fraternal - you have to have been a part of their corporate audit staff, leadership development programs, or have gone to a highly ranked business school.  Advancement outisde of those ranks is possible, but much tougher, and the higher you get, the more this will become apparent.

I thought communication throughout the leadership ranks was not that great.  There was little to no transparency (even though it was preached) and the workers doing the work were the last to know about very important company developments.  This might be attributed to the staff that is working within my group - but I have heard stories about this occuring else where.

GE is all about resources and scarcity.  If in 2005, you can do a job with 5 people, by 2010, you will only have 1 person to do the job and they will most likely have 15 other jobs attributed to them by the lack of resources.  Employees are expected to effectively manage this seeming impossibility, day in and day out.  I think this would wear someone out over an entire career - I personally do not plan on staying here much longer than 5-7 years.  Already, I work 9+ hour days and am expected to check my mail on weekends. This might again be a localized occurence for just me and my business, but I think it is a repetitive theme throughout GE.  I am all about working better and smarter, but at some point there are just not enough hours in the day to do what is put on your plate.","GE giving a general company earnings report is next to useless for the general public.

Employee Driven Annual Review Process, called EMS internally.  Basically each employee is required to do an internal resume of their qualifications, experience, accomplishments for the year, and your perceived strengths and weaknesses.  Then the EMS is reviewed by your manager and your manager's manager.  Your manager then does a counter-point to your listed accomplishments (or if you're well aware of your strengths and faults your manager will just agree with you), then you sit down privately with your manager to discuss views.  It really give the employee a chance to trumpet themselves to management, but it is really tough when you're fairly humble.

Regular raises, about every 18 month for most employees, every 12 months for the ""Top Talent"" in the company.

Great Benefits, the usual health, dental, vision, 401k, and vacation, plus discount programs for company products (what does GE not make, honestly) and partners.

Vast internal job opportunities, with so many divisions and locations in GE, there is a lot of potential places to go within the company.

Ambitious growth of the company, that so far has been sustained for a few years now.  Sustained double-digit revenue growth year over year is phenomenal for any company.

Recent addition of CTO position over Engineering.  Having an Engineer administrating the technical aspects of the company is the right thing to do.  Having an advocate for the technical people in the company is a great thing.  Too bad this is a recent development. 

At least in the groups I've worked in, my managers have been very flexible with work hours and time off.

Strong emphasis on Integrity, making sure things are done above-board.

It's nice getting instant, positive recognition from people when you say who you work for.","Re-org of the month club.  The upper management of the company can't seem to make up their mind about how the company structure should look.  In the time I've worked at GE there has been a re-org on average twice a year.  GE is one of the world's oldest companies, and one of the 5 largest, yet for some reason no one seems to agree on how we should look, internally or externally.

""Roof-top consolidation"" and Outsourcing.  I'm not sure what the problem is with having lots of small facilities, but management hates it like the plague, so they keep cutting facilities.  They seem to either consider people to be disposable, or somehow expect their whole workforce to be so loyal that they'll move anywhere from 50 to 2000 miles to keep their jobs.  Or they instead will just remove the facility entirely and move it to where labor is cheap, not seeming to care how long it will take to recoup the investment to move the manufacturing, nor the loss of good-will and respect with their customers and employees.

Lean workforce and getting leaner.  Every time I think we're a skeleton crew, they find more flesh to remove.  Whether through attrition or layoffs, each time people go, they're not replaced, but somehow we're supposed to get just as much done.

Far more outside managers hired than people promoted within.  This is actually double-edged, because sometimes outside people are needed to break the status quo, but we need to be weeding out the incompetence, not bringing in fresh supplies of it.

We at least get regular raises, which is better than some companies, but with the 18 month frequency for most employees, the raises don't keep up with inflation.  The only way to get a real pay raise is to change jobs.

Minimal upward mobility.  Maybe its just my division, but with so many managers being hired from outside, it leaves no place to go up where I am.  I expect I'll have to find a different part of the company to move up to the next rung.","#1. Stop with the re-orgs, just hold where you are and make it work.  There is no magic bullet.

#2. The customer should be #1 and your employees #2, right now it seems like we're at the bottom of the list behind everyone else.

#3. Hire from within where possible but PLEASE fatten up the workforce, we can't do our jobs with no man power.
