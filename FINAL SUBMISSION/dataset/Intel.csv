9,"Nov 4, 2019","""Great opportunities and benefits""",Current Employee - Software Engineer,"Hillsboro, OR",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,I have been working at Intel Corporation full-time for more than 8 years,"For technical jobs, Intel is a company with a lot of opportunities, especially if you have a very good understanding of low-level hardware and very good at software or development (depending on the job).  Also, it's a fairly big company, so if you want to move to a different job, you can look at the many internal job postings.
- The pay is fairly good (and includes quarterly bonuses) and benefits are good.
- Health insurance also (optionally) cover a spouse.  Plans include copay which might be around $250/month or high-deductable plans where you don't pay anything until you see the doctor.  Kaiser insurance even provides up to $40,000 for fertility treatments (i.e., egg extraction and preservation).
- Good paid time off: 3 weeks of paid time off to start, and a sabbatical where you can take 4 paid weeks off every 4 years or wait 7 years for 8 weeks off paid
- Managers are generally willing to openly meet with you if you want to talk to them about any concerns or anything else.
- 401k plan with some matching (including traditional 401k and Roth 401k)
- Discounted Intel stock purchase plan
- Discounts available on many consumer goods (currently via partnership with a site called beneplace.com)
- Some local businesses & restaurants offer an Intel employee discount if you show them your ID badge or other proof of employment
- Intel's employee discount on Intel computer processors is a great deal.  If you or family members like to build their own desktop PC, you can buy Intel processors from Intel internally at about 50% of their retail price (though Intel prioritizes external customers, and sometimes CPUs can be out of stock in their employee purchase program for a while).","- Some managers are better than others.  You might be well-liked and inspired by some managers, and less liked by more critical managers.  I've had the feeling that some managers are less personable than others and don't care as much about the people as other managers, so for instance, sometimes it can be hard to move into a different role on the same team if you want to.
- Periodic layoffs: I suppose this is common with any company, but Intel sometimes changes the company's direction and this can result in sometimes massive layoffs (as was the case in 2016) or smaller layoffs due to budget, etc.  Oregon (as with many states) is an ""at-will"" employment state, which means either the company or employee can terminate employment at any time for any/no reason.  Intel can announce your job is being cut at any time, though they are fairly decent about it - With a job cut, you could potentially still stay with the company for a couple months or so while you look for other work within the company or outside the company, and they have a severance package that can include 1 week of pay for each year you've been there; also, if you haven't taken your sabbatical, company policy is that they pay you for your sabbatical after you leave the company.
- Some teams work with people in countries on other continents (such as India or Israel), which may require occasional meetings with them outside of usual working hours.","At this time of writing, hopefully Intel can get its manufacturing on track, as Intel has been lagging behind competing companies such as AMD and Nvidia in chip manufacturing."

- Can be a good company at which to start a career.
- Sabbaticals are a nice benefit.
- Good maternity and bonding leave benefits compared to most U.S. companies.
- Intel has a general expectation that its employees are responsible professionals, so office employees are rarely micro-managed.","- The accountants are running things (literally). 
- The company is more profitable than it has ever been, yet still finds ways to reduce benefits nearly every year.
- Doing a good job and earning a raise appears to increase an employee's chance of being fired since that raise has now made the employee more expensive than lower-performing peers.
- The company earns billions, yet still manages to structure layoff criteria in ways that ""coincidentally"" disproportionately target older workers.
- Executives seem to see employees as little more than an expense line in a ledger that should be slashed whenever a boost to profit margins is desired, rather than as people who are committed to the success of the company and who have families and lives that may be irreparably harmed.","Intel regularly stresses internally how much it values its employees, but its layoff practices, years of benefit cuts, and its preference to fire and replace rather than retrain demonstrate something different. If you are not at a director level or higher, your job is always at risk of being eliminated on a whim because someone decides that an internal organization should be 5% smaller based on some random metric.

Not allowed to work when off the clock. Compressed work week is nice if you like to live for the weekend.,"*Soon to be former employee, here's why!*
If you have a BS in engineering/science, and have loans to pay off then this job is not worth it for you. The job really only requires that you are a person that is willing to learn, other than that it is basically manual labor. Nothing against people in manual labor jobs, and If you spent 4+ years and $100k in college to do manual labor, then this is the job for you. But if you ask me, you can do so much better than this job. But for some reason, upper management in the Portland plants think that you're not good enough to do an engineering job when I know more techs that would be way better at it then most the engineers that I have met. 
There is also no upward mobility. You can possible get the Night shift Engineer position, but pay is the same, and now you are salary and have 10x more work to do. Definitely not worth the headache","-Use some basic logic for once. 
-Don't encourage engineers to put off problems until they break, if the job was done correctly the first time, there would be less downtime in the long run. 
-Don't be elitist. Pay your workers accordingly. Portland is an expensive place to live, If you convert pay to the cost of living to any small city, I would be making round 36K. That's barley above the average living wage for the US, (meaning my current income is barley above a living wage in Portland). To put it in perspective, I make about $-5/month after loans and rent and a very very very basic food budget. (Oh don't worry, I never wanted to own a house, or have kids anyways and I like being almost homeless every month.) If you want to pay workers accordingly, don't require a bachelors degree for a job that can be done by someone right out of high school, and then pay that person like they are someone right out of high school. Seams.... logical (refer to first point in section)."

Strong brand. Enjoys a very wide competitive moat with its x86 product line. The company is trying hard to transform from a PC-centric business to
data-centric business, but faces significant headwinds and competition in new markets. Few decent acquisitions in the past with good
margins. Payoff on others remain to be seen.
Great people and work-life balance. Strong technical contributors

profit sharing. Decent ESPP plan.","If you are an engineer, your mileage will vary depending on the team and the manager. It is easy to get stuck as a cog in a hundred thousand machine.

heavy-lift, while others easily slack off. Inefficiency is rarely punished.

Slow decision making at the corporate level, which is slowly, but surely making way into newer acquisitions. Hierarchical corp. structure and deep layers
of middle management, some of whom are non-technical. 
Fair amount of internal politics. Hard to get promoted beyond a grade level which leaves no option other than to look for jobs outside. Average
compensation (esp. in the bay area).  Low on stock rewards and the stock has barely moved up. Inconsistent hiring standards and nepotism in some teams, which often lead to bad hires who eventually rotate to other teams.  Cost-cutting and hiring freeze have become the norm.

There is no straight talk between the middle-managers to the rest. There is only BS and it is pervasive. Everyone knows this.

Today, Intel has virtually nothing to show for those tens of billions invested outside of its single core product. Why?

Too much time is spent trying to educate management rather than doing the work to make a positive impact.

Intel promotes their pay equity, but pay equity can only exist when the staff is in the right pay grade. Major complaint is that even when proving you are doing the work of the next grade, or possibly two grades, there are consistent excuses as to why you can’t get a promotion, such as there is a “waiting list” and you’re far down on the list, or due to reorg you’re in a new group and need to prove yourself again (even though your job/goals didn’t change). Most of us who discuss these challenges are women, yet Intel supposedly has achieved pay equity and met their diversity goals. If consistently exceeds isn’t going to be considered, why have it?

Cost cutting has slowed innovation, reduced community initiatives and has dramatically slowed the pace of change.","Trust the employees you hire to make decisions - empower staff.

Achieve true pay equity. Promote those who are achieving at the next level. Excuses only frustrate employees and prompt them to quit. Study the number of external hires that leave shortly after hiring as compared to those who have been there a long time.
