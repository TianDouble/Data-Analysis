1,"Jun 21, 2013","""Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable""",Former Employee - Program Manager,"Mountain View, CA",4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,I worked at Google full-time for more than 8 years,"1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :(","1) Don't dismiss emotional intelligence and adaptive leadership.  They're not just catch phases.  You need great managers and leaders in order to build great companies and develop great employees.  The people who may be brilliant at solving technical issues may not be (and are most often, not) the best candidates for management. 

2) Do something about that work-ife balance.  Don't just have a bunch of pow-wows and tech talks and discussions about it.  Leadership should actually model it.  Consider re-evaluating how work is done; what processes are in place that are inefficient and ineffective and need to be updated or removed?  

3) Don't forget that there is already a pool of incredibly talented people within the company.  If career development is really a goal at Google, then do it.  Don't just hire from the outside.  Take the time to help your employees develop their careers - then maybe you won't lose some of the great ones, and maybe you'll have prevent some of that burn out and disillusionment."
2,"May 10, 2014","""Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects""",Current Employee - Software Engineer III,"New York, NY",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,I have been working at Google full-time for more than a year,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",Keep the focus on the user. Everything else will follow.
3,"Feb 8, 2015","""The best place I've worked and also the most demanding.""",,"Mountain View, CA",5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,I have been working at Google ,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.","Keep on NOT micromanaging - that is a huge benefit to Google. Most of us have a huge workload and we work in spikes and not chained to our desks, and we care deeply about producing, and we produce a lot. We can do that because you respect us enough to give us some freedom in how we do our jobs."

From the amazing perks like unlimited food,  to free transportation to work, to everything in between, the company really does have everything you could want from a benefits package.","The downside of having all of this, is that you attract the worlds best colleagues. Seemingly you would think this is a good thing, and while to a degree it is (pretty much everyone I work with is outright brilliant), the repercussions of this are far greater than you would initially assume.  Imagine the most type A, overachieving folks in your old college classes. You know, the ones that will literally go way above and beyond to do a truly exceptional job (chances are if you work at Google you were one of those folks). Now imagine only the top 1% of all of those people are in one place at the same time. Now think about what happens to the culture when you put all of those folks together and keep hiring them as your company scales. Suddenly everyone is taking  on the max possible amount of work and doing the equivalent of 3 people's workload, and then that becomes the norm for everyone. And no one will ever complain about it because at the end of the day everyone wants to be a team player and never say no to a request, regardless of the time commitment. This leads to everyone working long hours, working on vacations, and even while sick. 

To make matters worse, your manager is probably the same way. Since Google will hire a director from another company and make them a manager at Google (because Google is so big a director's scope of work will be similar to that of a manager at Google), chances are your direct manager has the ambition of a top preforming senior leader. And while they are likely to be very nice (for example my current manager is absolutely amazing) , they will set your workload based on your peer's workload since the average assumption is that if the others on the team can do it, why can't you?

Put this all together and you quickly have folks burning out left and right, and consequentially a very low average tenure for your team despite people loving their core jobs. It quite sad really because everyone I know in my Org is very happy outside of the amount of burnout they feel.  

Another important note is that it takes forever to get promoted at Google because regardless of how good the quality of your work is, you have to compete against colleagues who generally speaking are willing to do whatever it takes, and make any life compromise necessary to get promoted.

Overall, I think Google is a well intended company, with well intended employees that sadly have fell victim to losing their own culture through scaling and hiring the best.","Be consciousness of what example you are setting for your directs . It is completely okay to be ambitious and hard working, but understand that type of workflow isn't sustainable over long periods of time.  Very few people want to leave the team because they are unhappy, most leave because they simply are burned out and have already given everything they can to the team.

We love Google, but it has to be a team effort to keep making it a wonderful place to work as we continue to grow."

The company may seem fantastic if you're a fresh graduate who's still overawed by free food and on-site laundry. But once you reach the higher levels, you'll realize that the company has become a cloying, insular, and claustrophobic place. Internal technology falls further behind the outside world every day, but people still speak and act like they did when Google was years ahead of everyone else. It's an environment of total hubris.

God help you if you try to rock the boat. If you do, people snipe at you in design documents, slander your work and your mannerisms behind your back, and undermine you in performance reviews, all the while presenting just enough of a friendly facade to maintain plausible deniability. Nobody will tell you what's really going on. Very few people are interested in technical excellence. The joke is that Google hires the smartest people to ""move protos"" (i.e., do drudge work) all day. It took me years to realize that the ""move protos"" meme resonates because the L7-L9 old-time clique comes down like a fist on anyone trying to do more than make uncreative, incremental, and low-impact changes.

Maybe you don't care about technical excellence. If you don't, you won't be alone: ""merit"" and ""heroism"" are dirty words at Google. Maybe you want to work your 10-4 job, land a few CLs, eat your free lunch, get your middling performance scores, and collect your above-average paycheck, all the while crusading on memegen or whining about how unfair it is that the company evaluates your performance twice per year. If that's what you want to do, Google is the place for you. But if you're the kind of person who wants to advance technology, to apply your intellect to hard problems, and to bring something new into the world, then (unless you get extraordinarily lucky with team placement) Google will suffocate you. Go anywhere else.",Elevate technical excellence over internal politics.

Kind, brilliant, reliable, funny.
- Great compensation for non-tech; I will not easily be able to match my total comp package elsewhere for a PMM role
- Lots of responsibility available if you want it
- Prestige factor; once you have Google on your resume you can work anywhere

I used to love working at Google - a factor of being early in my career, and starting out when the company was only 20k employees. I learned a ton and made some great friends. But over time, the cons really started bothering me and I left.","- Stakeholder management is rough. It's a huge company that refuses to adapt to being a huge company. If you worked at Samsung or Amex, there would be a clear hierarchy of decision-making and approvals. Google is huge but teams rarely have any clear approval processes, decision-making processes, etc. It is all decided by individual team managers, most of whom don't set up a process at all or stick by it. So you end up halfway finished with a project, and then your manager will ask you to get approval from a random PM, and then you have to start all over. It's insanity and nothing gets out the door on top because of this.
- Bad managers are never held accountable. Basically if you're a star-performer individual contributor, you'll get a direct report, under the assumption that you'll create even more value when you have help. Not because you display any great leadership or managerial prowess. If your team continues to *produce good work*, you'll keep rising and you'll certainly keep your team. If you get consistently terrible management feedback scores, you'll still get promoted if you produce good work. Bad managers never get held accountable, your feedback will not get any serious response - just a LOT of meetings to ""discuss"" what's wrong  and some vague action plan like ""manager will send more regular updates and hold more 1:1s"".  Consequently, finding a team where you do work you enjoy AND there's a great manager is like finding the holy grail. 
- Product excellence and solving for users' needs is not really strongly prioritized. Instead, you feel a strong sense of ""we can't fall behind and thus are creating a copycat product from our competitor"" - see Google Home, messenger apps, Google Shopping Express. PMs are incentivized to ship products, and often things go out the door that lack product-market fit.","The above cons are well-known and will not be fixed unless an  SVP cares to do so, and even then, it'll only be because the market demands those changes.

Thus, 15 - 30% salary reductions for all sales. Mine was a $25K reduction. On paper, having a 40/60 split would be amazing because we can make more on the upside. The reality is that with a revenue recognition model that is based on consumption, you will need a healthy consumption machine to hit your number.

At every other company, there were lots of people who had serious gaps in their skills. At Google, I could have a serious work conversation about technology with everyone and could trust that they have solid expertise. In that way, Google is a sheltered garden from the rest of the world.

There is a general sense of trust in the company. You can leave your valuables and laptops lying around, and they are safe. People joke that it's the only place where you use an expansive laptop to reserve a seat at the cafeteria, while walking away.

At other companies, teams are very protective of their own code. Trying to execute another team's code requires following a 50 step installation process that's out of date and was never complete to begin with. Google has almost all the code in the same source repository. An engineer can look at the code, easily execute the code because it comes with intelligent defaults and standard build process, and contribute enhancements/bug fixes. The other teams are generally grateful for getting improvements. They understand that it's better for the company if the bug is fixed rather than holding onto territory or insisting on their own strange ways.

Google takes care of you all around. From food, health care, generous vacation, onsite gym, and so on, you are well taken care off and can focus on work rather than dealing with life's hassles. There are cases where Google goes above and beyond tremendously. Here is an example that floats around internally. A Googler had worked at Amazon before. Amazon relocated him. Because of the relocation, he had to change his partner's health insurance for some critical and expensive life changing medication. Due to same sex partner and relocation, the health insurance company refused. Amazon was so unhelpful that the HR representative who was forced to deliver the news broke down crying and then quit over it. He switched to Google. The Google HR department negotiated an exception for him with the health insurance and included the necessary change for the following policy year for all  employees.

A lot of Google products have a huge impact with over a billion users. Working there, you can feel that you change the world.

I was very happy with the compensation. There are also a lot of opportunities in the company to follow your interest. Pretty much anyone can get an intern, participate in setting coding standards (obviously you have to argue the case for your proposals), interviewing, supporting local schools with tech expertise. Google opened up a lot of opportunities in the community or in general in tech to volunteer in.

Google is considered the largest functioning anarchy. That has its good sides, like the glee of joy for operating without strict oversight. It also has its dark side, like a hands-off management tends to encourage politics.

Another beauty for engineers are internal tools. Your development environment is in the cloud. You can sit down at a loaner computer and be productive within seconds. There is a massive cloud compiling system that shards your compiles across many computers in the cloud. The search function across the codebase is powerful. You'll feel that downloading and compiling code on your own computer in your IDE is something of another epoch, like something from before the industrial revolution.

The Google badge is a wonderful thing to carry. It opens doors to a different world. The office spaces are beautiful with work, rest, and play areas. The MTV location is like a utopian city on its own. Everything in it, food, drinks, work spaces, swimming pools, gym, bowling alleys, showers, and so on are free (for employees). It is a whole world of its own.

Most companies have a one-over-one promotion model. Your boss has to decide to promote you. Your bosses boss has to sign off on it. At Google, the promotion is decided by a relatively impartial committee that due to promoting lots of people has experience in it. You can even get promoted in rare cases against the will of your manager. Rumor has it that managers won't hold a grudge if that happens but support it. The hiring committee looks at a promotion packet that includes reviews from peers. There can even be unrequested peer reviews. In general, it creates an environment that discourages bicycling - bowing to the higher ups and kicking the lower downs hard. However some people have realized that they can hurt colleagues with bad reviews and impunity. It's rare, but colleagues careers took a dive due to someone holding a grudge or simply writing a thoughtless review. (There is some concern about stack ranking, but I don't understand enough of the background to comment on it. There are plenty of discussions with insight elsewhere.)

To underscore how Google is one of a kind, there is an internal database with legendary things that happened at Google. Someone parked his car for many years on the employee parking lot. When after years, he went looking for his car, it was gone. He went to security. He found out that it was simply moved because the parking lot had been repaved. Another Googler lived in the office fulltime to save money on rent. He wrote a guide on how to do that. As there are showers and other facilities, it is possible to do so. And Google let it happen. After a while of saving rent payment, he could afford the down payment on buying his own place. All these stories make Google a wonderful place to work at.

An important topic to bring up is work/life balance. Work/life balance is an amorphous topic that means a lot of different things to different people. Getting up to speed at Google is consuming. Depending on your work, it could take a year to become productive. Many colleagues reported no longer having a personal life after starting at Google. Some colleagues simply love technology and can't think of anything better than  working until the AM hours on some tech that gets them excited. You can tell these people by physically looking at them. For them, it is a heaven. If you are a balanced person with personal interests and relationships, you are likely going to be challenged. If you signed up for one of the big five tech companies, you wanted challenge, right. If I would do something differently, it is to take advantage of all time saving things. Pay for a laundry service. Pay for a cleaning service. I've had a moral hangup about doing that because on a moral level, my time shouldn't be more worthy than that of another human being. If I could do it all over again, I'd pay for every possible service to save time. In the grander scheme of things, if you work at Google, your skill is so valuable to humanity that you should make use of it instead of standing in line at the grocery store. I don't mean that in an arrogant way. If you work on a service with a billion users, your ability to make life better for them with another hour of work is worth more than folding laundry. You've paid the price in education, training, and effort to be able to do that. Make use of your power for the great code. (The view that all those perks are only there to keep your nose closer to the grindstone is the wrong way of looking at it from a philosophical point, in my humble opinion.)

For full disclosure, there are some people who coast at Google. They probably don't have any complains about work/life balance or perhaps the worst complaints because they are all about coasting.

Many company mishandle projects. When the next time comes around, they mishandle it in the same way because the people responsible aren't the ones working late nights and weekends. Google does two things to get better: (1) There are honest and public postmortems. They are the pride of a lot of true engineers. (2) Zeitgeist is an annual survey about the work place and the company. The survey is quite exhaustive. Every manager from the CEO to the front-line manager reports on the result of his/her area. Then they take actions to attempt to improve areas that got low scores. Having worked at companies where now improvement effort is done, this annual and systematic process is very refreshing.","If you don't work in MTV (HQ), you will be given work. However if you are passionate and want to advance your career, you should relocated to MTV. Any project that started doing well and getting important seemed to get transferred there. Promotion opportunities are better there. It seemed that everyone who relocated from another location to MTV, was a lot happier.

Officially, the company focuses on impact. In practice, it seems to focus on being highly productive in producing code, but not necessarily in actually succeeding. In theory, if you have a simple idea that doubles the revenue/customer satisfaction, it should be more appreciated than an idea that took a lot of effort/difficulty and had less improvement. But it tends to be the other way.

Promotions tend to be tied to launching a project that makes peers at a higher level happy. That's often easier with an API that happens to be really useful for peers than launches that benefit users. Landing the right kind of project to work on is a big factor of getting a promotion, which is easier in MTV and also encourages politics. A colleague was told directly from his boss that he has to get better at ""turf war.""

A general rule of thumb is that everyone ends up in ads. Non-ads projects tend to be more volatile and have a tendency to end with people ending up on ads projects. This is not necessarily a con. One should simply prepare for it.

There seems to be a general trend as Google gets larger (60K+ employees) and the founders are withdrawing their impact on the company that Google's specialty is fading a bit. Microkitchens stock less eye popping snacks and drinks. The Christmas gift went from a nice bundle of cash to a coveted phone to a cheap phone to simply a donation to a charity of your choice. The hiring bar seems to get lowered to satisfy the need to hire more people.

Managers tend to become managers for their tech skills and not management skills. It definitely shows in the quality of management. Very smart people, very technically capable, not so business and people savvy. This is not necessarily a complete con because a manager without a clue in tech is definitely a lot worse.

There are some stars that people belief that Google still has but doesn't. The myth of 20% time is alive outside of Google. It's discouraged inside of Google. The only person whom I knew to participate in 20% time did so by working on another team, which he wanted to test out before transferring. Outside people belief that 1 day a week a Google can work on anything he/she deems interesting. Management doesn't outright deny it, but it's formulated as: If you work 20% time on something else, it has to have company impact worth 20%. This is not necessarily a con. It's more like a missing pro.

Another shining star that's gone is the ""don't be evil"" motto. It was silently dropped and replaced with ""do the right thing."" Google didn't turn overnight evil. There is some philosophical case to be made why the new motto is better. However it seems with the founders drawing back from company involvement that the dramatic standing up for users of the old times is also fading. Google is still a far cry from Monsanto.

If you work there and want to advance your career, don't volunteer for anything. It is kind of viewed as a ""vacation"" if you volunteer for things. For example at other employers, interviewing was viewed as a prestigious activity reserved for the most trusted employees to shape the future. At Google, any hour you spend interviewing means missing an hour to increase your performance score. You'll be rewarded for finding ways to dug out of the interviewing responsibility. Again this is not necessarily a con, simply something to understand.

You are going to meet some of the brightest and most brilliant people. You are going to meet people with interesting backgrounds. You are going to have wonderfully engaging conversations. But all of that intelligence tends to also have caused nature to create that intelligence at a trade-off (in some people). Perhaps a lack of humanity or emotion was the price of it in some people. You are going to have some lunch conversations that are going to make you spit your food back out, like a colleague seriously proposing to use nuclear bombs to solve social issues. I sometimes felt the need to take a break from the office to be around people who display normal emotions (or any emotion). While the general office culture is very liberal/progressive, there are some pockets of social beliefs that are breathtaking to how little they care about human life or different lifestyles/opinions out of some law of the strong or ultra libertarian reasoning.","Promote managers into management for their manager skills. Train manager in managing skills (both business and people managing skills).

Focus more on the user. It seems that OKRs are more focused on internal metrics than actually understanding the user and making them happy.

Fantastic workplace perks and benefits.,"I was at Google for the better part of a decade, and during that time observed many changes in the company culture and leadership strategy. Generally, Google still behaves a lot like a startup, which is not really the right model for a company nearing 100,000 employees. The product strategy is poorly thought out and the culture encourages teams to spin up new product efforts without doing their homework and thinking beyond the first launch. As a result, many new products end up getting launched which have poor longevity. Google also expects that every product scale up to the billion+ user level which means that many niche products don't get the support they deserve. Finally, leadership has become increasingly disconnected from the rank-and-file of the company, and trust in HR and leadership is very low. The most obvious example of this was the $90M payment to the head of Android after being accused of sexual harassment, but there are countless other examples of recklessness and poor judgment by the company's leadership.",

The dependency is not sustainable, especially not in operation type roles.  It's a never ending cycle. I felt really bad for the TVCs on my team!","Value your people more. Recognize and reward them more, don't continually punish.  Don't criticize your peer's work, but educate them on best practices on why things should be perceived in a certain way. There is no wrong or right way of doing things, remember that. That's inhibiting creativity, ironically something that Google is known for as a brand.

Work/life balance is not great, and they offer a lot of perks to help with stress and mental health (like massages, 25 counseling sessions a year, discounts to the Headspace app, meditation rooms, etc.) but in practice it seems like lip service.

People are encouraged to serve their self interests instead of what’s best for the company or consumer.  In order to get promoted, you need to launch something impactful.  Sounds valid right?  No, because once something launches people move on to the next big thing instead of maintaining the product.

As such, people who are rude, sexist, unpleasant and not team players get promoted.  One of the Sr product managers drives his roadmap entirely based on what will get attention from marketing or in the press, so instead of building for everyone, we build based on what new idea marketing has.  On top of that, he had had multiple complaints filed against him be women, and has faced no disciplinary action.

Also, this is one place where you are constantly told to “stay in your lane”.  I’ve never worked anywhere where trying to fill gaps in for the team have repeatedly been not only discouraged, but dinged for.  And the justification is always “it won’t help your perf.”  Meaning that I can’t get raises, bonuses or promotions because I’m doing something off my official job description.

I was honest with the Google recruiters and told them I had an offer on the table. They told me Google would offer me the job b/c my interviews had gone well (I did all of the hangouts, went onsite, etc.). They even asked me what the offer was and assured me that Google would beat it. We discussed exact figures. Things were going great. We communicated multiple times, both on the phone and through email. Each time, they said an offer was coming & repeatedly told me not to sign with anyone, but I'd have to wait a few more days or ""next week"". Eventually, the other company pulled their offer. I informed the recruiters of this and they said they'd have a verbal offer for me in the coming days. By this time, we are about 2 months into the process. I've heard that it can take up to 3 months to get into Google, so I was complying with everything they said. Another week went by. Late on a Friday afternoon, I get a voicemail (not a phone call) from one of the recruiters. She says there is no offer and she cannot tell me why, but I can call her if I have questions. Of course I do, so I call. She will not pick up. I left her a voicemail, asking for her to get back to me. To this day, she is yet to return my call. Here I am, without a Google offer and I burned a bridge with a great company that actually did want me. Definitely not the experience I was expecting from a leader in our industry.

This was probably the best side hustle I've ever had especially because I already had a job on top of this one. A couple months ago the ENTIRE PAY MODEL CHANGED! I went from making about $600-$800 every pay period to about $350. When you calculate that I realized I wasn't making anymore than around $5 per hour. Completely ridiculous! They also implemented these ""tiers"" which make no sense imo. I was sending clients great suggestions and developing relationships with them and my pay reflected that  yet I was put in one of the lowest tiers, so I completely stopped working. It became a waste of time even if you have nothing to do - it's still a waste of time because if you're not spending 15 min on one client due to all of the tech issues then you're waiting hours at a time for someone to pop in your queue and hopefully you snag them before the other hundreds of stylist waiting do.

Was promised to have 6 months of learning (like all Nooglers do, regardless of level), but by 9 months, despite tons of good work already went in with measurable improvements,  was already criticized by the manager, f2f, word exactly: ""do you feel it a shame that xxx is still broken?"".  Manager was a nerdy, self-eccentric, and ruthless ""genius"".   Here is his favorite behaveour: in private conversations he says: "" you are the TL, you should have a vision, should be the role model, and should lead the team"".  In the public, however, he does everything he can to knock you down as a TL! He would refute the comments you post on junior team member's code view, for very insignificant reasons. He would criticize & question your own code change in all the ways he can, making it stay in review for 2-months, without any significant functional changes (Yes it was working from day 1). Yet, he comes back to criticize hard your code velociy, citing the 2-month code review as a critical evidence! He assigns some one from a remote location to work on this component, without even notifying you! You see old teammates who worked on this component for many years  leaving the group. Finally, you see your manager himself also leaving the company.","I have had 20 years industry experience. This company is by far the worst.

My experience in Cloud was disappointing, and not a day goes by where I don't regret leaving earlier. My current team, while not perfect, treats me with respect; it really goes to show how huge the variation can be across Google.

Here are many lessons I've learned in my previous team which I hope will benefit you:

- If your project is not listed as part of an OKR (Objective & Key Result), no one cares about your project. While most managers will make sure you have a project that can grow your skills and career, many won't and may even try to mislead you into believing your project is more meaningful than it is. Voice your concerns, and firmly ask for a meaningful project. As an L3 engineer, it is not your duty to come up with projects, so your manager has the responsibility to find a good one for you.

- If you feel your career is going nowhere, transfer to a different team (which can be done without manager approval after 1 year). Do not fall into the sunk costs trap of refusing to leave because you didn't get what you wanted out of your 1 year on the team. For my first half year at Google, I fixed bugs, set up system health monitoring, did deprecations, refactorings, migrations, etc but never had a genuine project. I thought that after a half year of BS work, I would be given better opportunities. Then, I was assigned a monolithic project. I worked long hours to move the project forward. However, our sibling team repeatedly bailed on their responsibilities in the project, and I had to continuously adapt the design accordingly. Eventually, it became clear that our sibling team was not going to contribute anything, and I felt I could no longer leave the team because the project would require significantly more work than initially anticipated. After one year of working on this project, our management decided not to launch without any basis. If you're not treated well after a year, don't think your coworkers and boss will suddenly start treating you well in your second year or even third year. Don't be idealistic or loyal because Google was rated #1 in employee happiness; it's a big company and not every team is the same.

- Management is perfectly fine wasting 1+ years of your time rather than have an honest conversation about the relevance of your project. On my previous team, this was the norm, not the exception. See the previous bullet point for one example, but this had also happened to my next project, as well as many of my coworkers' projects. The reality is: Managers don't face as much penalty for cancelled projects as engineers. Some managers have 30 reports working under them on a variety of projects, and the performance evaluation has a word limit and a limit of 5 projects. If a project fails, managers can just add more words to the other projects. However, as an entry-level engineer, you may only be working on 0-2 projects, so a cancelled project is much more detrimental to you. The same applies for cross-team collaborations. Make sure the partnering team has a tangible investment in your project. People have a tendency to promise commitments for a reputation boost, but when it comes to actually doing the work, they will flake if there's nothing in it for them. One way to reduce the chance of your project getting abandoned is to make sure your project is part of your team's (or the partnering team's) OKRs. Managers have an explicit responsibility to fulfill their OKRs.

- In 1-on-1 meetings, do not believe everything your manager says about your career path. Actions speak louder than words. Has your manager been giving you ample project opportunities for growth? Are you getting opportunities for impact comparable to your peers? If the answer to these questions is no, you're not on a strong path to promotion, no matter what your manager says. At Google, performance evaluations are done at a cycle of every half-year. In my second cycle, my manager told me I performed well, and was on track to getting promoted in the next cycle. In the following cycle though, my manager said it may take another 1 year before I would get promoted, even though I never received any indication I had gone off-track. While I would imagine most managers are honest about your career growth, some aren't. By telling you that you have a chance at promotion in the next cycle even if it's not true, they have effectively kept you for another half-year and postponed any consequences for their dishonesty until then. Also, it does not matter if you're assigned an unimportant project or your coworkers failed to do their part. No one is going to say: ""Johnny's project failed to launch, but Johnny did an excellent job and deserves to be promoted anyway"" because it implies someone else should be blamed, and no one is willing to make that sacrifice for you. Also, the promotion committee frankly doesn't care; they need to see measurable impact because that's one of the criteria for promotion, regardless of whose fault it is.",

With a few caveats, anyone interested in challenges should consider working here.

1. In contrast to recent complaints within the company about compensation, you are well compensated in engineering here. Period. You might be able to find better at a startup or another big tech firm, but make no mistake, Google pays highly overall. Look at the salaries page here on Glassdoor and you'll see that right away.

2. The office atmosphere in Boulder is great. As a satellite office with experienced-trending engineers, it's more relaxed than Mountain View with most of the same perks. A decent gym, bouldering wall, and full cafeteria are all things to mention.

3. Work life balance, while very team dependent, is generally superb . I work 8 hours a day, don't carry a pager, and feel no pressure to work more than that. I don't feel the slightest bit of scrutiny if I need to work from home, or go to a comfy nook somewhere out of sight to get some work done.

4. Again, in contrast to recent complaints from Googlers, the senior leadership at Google (thinking of Sundar here) is *very* open. Find me another 80,000 person company that has its CEO answer crowd-sourced questions on very emotional issues like compensation and diversity.

5. I generally have positive human interactions here. There's the typical swath of introverted and occasionally awkward engineers, but generally speaking everyone is ""Googley"", i.e. considerate at a level above the average human on the street.","The big cons fall into two categories: engineering and company.

Engineering specific:

1. The internal tools, compared to open source projects and other companies, suffer from immense proliferation and domain overlap. There are too many ways to deploy code, too many ways to look at a metric graph, too many ways to build a Java library, too many ways to spin up an RPC server, and the list goes on. This ultimately means that none of the products are very satisfactory. There's too much license to ""innovate"" on the fundamental building blocks, and the engineering culture as a whole needs to enforce more standards. 

2. It's an extremely common practice for engineers (i.e. with a title of software engineer) to have direct reports. The result is a bunch of very technical leaders who don't care as much about people operations. This is great when you need backing for a proposal, but sub-par when you need to talk about career development or other non-technical topics.

3. Technical Googlers are promoted predominately for ""impact"" - think launching a new service, or saving the company $Xm. There does not seem to be heavy motivation to promote engineers who work hard to maintain stable and important systems. It's a running joke that in order to get promoted, it's better to deprecate something reliable and create something new. In other words, Google is an excellent place to gain experience, but to get ""promoted"", you're probably better off seeking out new opportunities. 

4. While mostly good people (especially at a company of 80k), Googlers can sometimes come across as entitled. Yes, finances in the Bay Area is hard even on a salary of $120k+, but the perspective on how much of a privilege it is to work here is sometimes lost.

5. Google is struggling with some of the same issues that the US is politically. The company has the best intentions, but does fall into a hysteria over ""diversity"". Less than 50% hiring of females in engineering is seen as a systemic problem. Google is slowly starting to realize that this is mostly a pipeline problem, especially considering that the industry (and company) makes enormous efforts to hire existing qualified women.  However, leadership does not seem very interested in respectful but contrary opinions on this topic, as the firing of James Damore demonstrated. If you care about racial and gender equality, but have doubts about a leftist political agenda, you may occasionally feel afraid to speak up at Google.","Select one or two engineering tools for each function and make them wonderful to use. We would be embarrassed to ask external developers to use our own internal coding and deployment infrastructure. What if GCP were so amazing that we used it internally for these processes? That would be a start.

Let Googlers bring themselves to work by listening to contrary (but respectful) opinions on topics such as gender/racial equality.

Promote those engineers who demonstrate a strong influence in maintaining and improving current systems. New products and features are great, but they shouldn't be the only way to get promoted."

617,"Feb 21, 2019","""Miserable!""",Current Employee - Wardrobe Stylist,"New York, NY",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I have been working at Google part-time for less than a year,"You can work remotely and whenever you want ""only if"" the ques are full and busy which is not usually the case.","Where do I start? 

In the beginning, all was great! Ques were full and you could make a decent income. As time went on, it's just gotten worse. 

The final nail in the coffin is their new pay model that now pushes commissions and sale incentives. We are no longer stylists. We are now expected to be online sales people! 

There is no rhyme or reason to the new pay model. One minute you are in the Platinum tier making good money and the next you are in a lower tier making a fraction of what you were making before. There is no explanation as to why you are promoted or demoted. It's like you are being punished when you move down a tier because you are no longer meeting their expectations and you will now make less money and have no idea when you may move up again. It's cruel. You are messing with peoples income. It's not right. 

I now work harder and longer hours to make less money despite following the laundry list of their new requirements and examples. We have to send the highest standard messages, send at least 35 items per message and stay with in the users profile requirements. It now takes me at least 10 minutes to send 1 message and that's not only because of their new expectations but also because of all the technical issues. We still get a daily ""Bad Request"" pop up message when trying to send messages and it interrupts your flow of work. Also, if the user doesn't put in all of their sizes, it limits results and we have to then manually do it which takes even more time. Not to mention Google Shopping is still not working. You have to manually click on each item to get the ""+"". This all takes more time and becomes so cumbersome. It's ridiculous! You put in so much time and effort for what? To make less $$ now than you did before despite elevating the quality of your work. You feel like a fool. 

Also, they keep on tooting sales and commissions as a good thing. I have yet to see it! It's hard enough to get someone to buy something and if they do, it has to be at least $30, not returned within 2 weeks and you only get a small percentage of the sale. It comes with all these caveats. They are trying to convince us of all the financial gains but that hasn't been the case. 

Lastly, I agree with the review below. The most recent reviews are bogus trying to off set all the negative reviews. You can tell by how generic, vague and overtly positive they are. Just scroll down to page 2 and read all the real reviews.","Show us a little more respect. We work very hard. It's not only about the user experience, it's about our experience as well. The new demands are unrealistic. 

I really enjoyed this job in the beginning. It was fun and I looked forward to logging in each morning. Now, I dread it not knowing what to expect. I hope that others will speak up and share their experiences."

But they don't outweigh the cons.","I spent 8 years overall at Google, leaving twice, going back once and was in serious talks to go back for a 3rd (!) time.  I worked on OS X desktop software, Google Breakpad, Google Health, Search, and, in my second stint from Sep 2015-Oct 2017, CorpEng, and was lucky to transfer between Mountain View, SF, and NYC on their dime over the duration of my employment.  

Google has some amazing, mostly unrivaled aspects to working there - the co workers, for one.  It's taking over large swaths of Manhattan so living & working for Google in NYC makes for a pretty fun lifestyle.  Other perks are also fantastic but companies are starting to catch up.  What makes Google not worth it these days, in my opinion, is both its seeming organizational inability to harness its employees' capabilities & intelligence to make products that matter AND the fact that people at the very highest levels (like, L-team levels) don't seem to care.  

If you're considering an offer, congrats!  It is no small amount of meaningful sweat and tears to get an offer from Google.   But take into account that the dream of working there comes from a brand that is slowly eroding as Google transitions from Silicon Valley darling to just another company.  Sadly, Google as a whole is less than the sum of its parts, and the organizational dynamics that need to be fixed at the highest levels are continually dismissed.","-Go could have been Swift, if the company had gotten behind it

Internal mobility is amazing. If you ever feel like you need a new team or a new challenge, you can transfer at will. Joining Google doesn't mean you join a particular team, it means you're entering a huge community of brilliant people doing exciting things who are eager to have you join them. 

You'll learn what it looks like when engineering is done right. Stay for more than a few years and recruiters won't be able to get enough of you. ""Ex-Googler"" carries a lot of weight, and I've seen lots of people leave Google to take on shockingly influential roles at startups and other companies.","Promotions are extremely demanding. When in doubt, the entire organization defaults to ""no,"" so you'll need to jump through a lot of hoops to get promoted. Promotions are centered around complexity and impact, which tends to discourage simple solutions to important product problems, as well as low-impact but important work like code maintenance. 

There have been some attempts to encourage more code maintenance but in my opinion it isn't being rewarded enough. As a result, there is a number of roles that people take on that you tend not to see, most notably that of the code style stickler whose impact comes in the form of improving existing code. 

Also on the topic of impact, you can execute a large, multi-year project and still not get promoted if it doesn't land with the expected impact.

This depends on personal preference, but the office spaces are almost universally open-plan, which some people find makes it difficult to focus. Google NYC has been in a real estate crunch for over four years, and people are being hired faster than we can build office space to accommodate them. Lots of trading floor-style desks.

Personal projects and side hustles are limited to what doesn't compete with any Google products. In theory it sounds reasonable, but in reality Google has a finger in pretty much every pie, which means you'll have to ask permission for everything you make outside work.",

I've made lifelong friendships with so many people and will take these relationships with me wherever I go.
- The scale of impact - every now and then I'll stop to consider the number of people the work I do has the chance to impact and it's staggering. Google does not do anything small - it's go big or go home.
- Continuous learning and development - the g2g program encourages googlers to be constantly learning and growing. I love that there is always some class offered that you can be taking to grow your technical or soft skills.","- Company size. This is a massive company and the size is starting to show. There is increasingly a lot of bureaucracy, promotions and performance management systems don't always reward top performance but rather who's been in line longest, and it's harder to get things done when you need approval from 15 different teams.
- Google Cloud is growing fast... But they're sacrificing culture and quality hiring for getting warm bodies to fill seats. The culture is increasingly toxic and it doesn't feel like Google - with all the focus on external hiring in Google Cloud, it feels more like VMware v2 or mini Amazon and that's not what I signed up for.
- Internal transfers are almost harder than getting into the company in the first place. I have internally interviewed for jobs that had 100+ INTERNAL candidates where they ended up only hiring two people in the end. I've also spent 6-12 months interviewing for 10 different roles internally before finally getting an offer on a different team.","Don't pay lipservice to diversity.

I find myself waiting for users to show up, which is not only a waste of my time, it definitely restricts my time flexibility which is the whole benefit of taking on this role.

I urge anyone considering this company to read through the previous reviews regarding the bait and switch, how they move you to an empty queue (no users to help) if you make a decent amount of money (and that amount is not disclosed, and they don't notify you that they are moving you), and how the ""management""  is not willing to communicate how anyone's pay is calculated.  

It has been an extremely disheartening and frustrating experience, and I cannot begin to express how disappointed I am that Google attaches itself to this app.  As the parent company, Google really should step in and do something.

And to the employee who commented that the issues involving pay and pay changes are borderline illegal...I can't disagree and wish someone had the ability to spark a change so that it's a better working environment which would then lend to a better user experience, and then make the app and company more successful.","Read these reviews, and learn than any reputable company starts with clear communication, being transparent with employees, and respecting their time.  You should not be able to hire people under one pretense, and then change their access to specific users just because they have made too much money for your preference.

They do an excellent job of outlining our company-wide mission, and fostering employees sense of personal responsibility to execute on that mission. The famous (or infamous, depending on your perspective) perks are just as enticing and rewarding as the hyperbole surrounding them.","Unfortunately, buses, on-site laundry, and massages don't pay the bills. Google pays exceptionally well, if you're on the engineering side of the company. If not, compensation hardly lives up to the hype. Example: an individual started in an entry-level role and was later moved into a position with much greater impact and significantly more responsibility within the same department. A year and a half later, that individual is still being paid at their entry-level pay and classified as their entry-level role, despite a complete change of responsibilities, scope of impact, skill requirements, etc.","Internal mobility rules / bureaucracy need a thorough overhaul. Internal rules require that an employee cannot apply for a role outside of their level (L1, L2, L3, etc.) Think purely lateral moves (changing roles) or purely vertical moves (promotions,) but diagonal moves (promotion into a new role) aren't allowed. Unfortunately, this creates pockets of stagnant employees, who have no opportunities for movement, laterally or vertically. For instance, there are approximately a half dozen departments that have full-time employees at the L2 level. But many of those teams do not have an L3 role that doesn't require people-management responsibilities. Obviously, there are a finite number of L3 roles as there is a finite number of people to manage. These L2 employees are effectively capped from promotion until an L3 leaves or is promoted (a frequency of approx 2 per year.) L2's are also boxed in laterally, as there are so few teams that offer L2 roles, meaning they are unable to transition into a role that offers greater vertical opportunities. For comparison, the vast majority of entry-level positions at Google (65% - 75%) are at the L3 or L4 levels, meaning that these employees are able to move freely between teams / departments / product areas, and thus circumvent the majority of these issues."

There are a few older people, but not many. So, these two complaints I've actually heard others mention as well. Overall feel is that they are hiring only certain types of people, even though their countless training videos say that they are supposed to be fair and square across the board.","You're great at hiring people of all ethnicities,now please consider hiring older people, and also encouraging your staff to be more friendly and practice their manners.

- Lots of learning available through talks, programs, classes
- Great deal of transparency across the organization
- Room to take risks and propose initiatives to receptive audiences
- Candid and honest communication from c-level leadership, including acknowledgement of mistakes","- Competition is fierce.  Everyone is striving for limited promotions and visibility, and that leads to people sabotaging or just not helping each other.
- Managers are powerful.  If yours doesn't want you to succeed, they have a great deal of control over your future at the company.
- Switching teams is not as easy as advertised.  Honestly, applying to Google from the outside is easier than trying to join a new team.  If your manager doesn't want you to switch teams, you will not switch teams.
- HR will not help you if a problematic situation happens.  They are there to protect the company.  While nice individuals, they will happily tell you untrue information to help Google and hurt you.
- Promotion culture is insidious.  Everyone is trying to get promoted to make more money, and the system around promotion encourages the wrong kinds of risk-taking: bold but useless new products, hoarding credit, blaming others for your mistakes.
- If a product is at risk, one or two people may be collectively blamed to save the whole.  I saw this happen multiple times.  A deadline is missed, so an agreement is hatched the the problem was person X or person Y.  That way, person X or Y can be fired and the others promoted because they made progress despite working with someone as lowly as X or Y.
- Fakeness.  Individuals at Google are largely wonderful, but the company encourages you to keep and tow the line.  Smile.  Be Googley.  Pretend we're all collaborating openly.  But, in the back of everyone's mind is their career path, their promo, and how other people can be used to get them there or discarded if they do not.
- A few PMs and manager are very poor performers and their teams suffer as a result.  Many PMs and managers are wonderful.  It depends on the team you get, which is largely a question of luck.  
- A culture which somewhat coddles through its benefits leads some to stay dependent and socially immature, especially if joined right out of college.","- Make switching teams easier.
- If it takes 20 people to promote someone, it should not take only one to fire.  Don't put all of this power in the hands of a single manager.
- Don't encourage people to work extensive hours at night and on weekends.  Explicitly Googlers are told not to work weekends, but we all know they do and the culture encourages it.  This is unfair to people with families and favors younger people with fewer responsibilities.
- Don't promote bullies, even if they get results.  It erodes culture and trust."

The best way to describe working here is STAY AWAY. Find a position at McDonalds or sweeping the streets you will be treated with more respect and your mental health will be 100 times healthier. The management team here consists of an older white tyrannical female, I will call her the big Boss, and a black gentleman, merely a lackie. The gentleman is merely a clone of the Boss and too terrified to contradict her. The black gentleman’s wife is in charge of the HR functions at the office, guess what your chances are of discussing and resolving any management issues are. Positions fall into 3 categories, company paid drivers, independent drivers and company paid Para Monitors. These Para Monitors are responsible for the safety of the passengers during transport, generally behaviorally challenged young people with special needs. Drivers are paid by the trip or the hour depending on their classification. Company drivers get assigned generally the long time because the company brings in more revenue. The independents are generally assigned short overflow trips which can earned them as little as $7-10. These drivers pay for their own vehicle, gasoline, insurance and on their own time. Drivers are in great demand due to the extremely high turnover, averaging 3-4 months. Lastly are the Para Monitors who are paid $50 per day for 2 split shift trips. The average work week is presented as approximately 14 hours as opposed to getting paid for 20. Great deal if you aren’t actually working 18-20. Due to the chaotic scheduling you will work one Para trip the remaining hours you will be dragged along with the driver because they lack the time to drop you off at the office. This is regardless if you have a appointment already scheduled. Sadly, it is totally impossible to schedule any personal obligations, such as shopping, doctor’s appointments and the like. The Boss lies when cornered regarding hours stating you are MINE from 6AM – 6PM. The work force is composed for the most part of house wives, retirees, and immigrants. These are the types of people that are focused for employment because they will generally take any kind of treatment and be happy to have a job, however many don’t last long. If you have a conflict with the tyrant boss you most likely will be unemployed shortly. She manages by intimidation. In her quest to terminate you and still not appear to be a tyrant she has been known to elicit the assistance of certain favorite personnel to assist her by lying and discrediting the employee in question. I know of an employee who required a sick day and was told they had to come in and fill out a request for a day off. If they didn’t follow that procedure it could be terms for termination. That employee could not make it in to fill out the request and was terminated. Lying to the employees is commonplace. To quote the big white tyrannical Boss, she stated on one occasion when someone took issue with something “forget them, they are a dime a dozen.” That certainly explains why the Boss focuses on hiring a certain type of individual. Employees are too terrified of the Boss and her insane attitude to standup for their rights for fear of being terminated or reprisal. Which is another whole talent the Boss’s takes to new limits."

- The stress, from what I've seen over my year there, is reasonable for most people.

- Google management is open and receptive to internal feedback and criticism.
- And you can't write a review about Google without mentioning the perks - amazing!","These aren't even really ""cons"" but things that are so different from the typical Fortune 500 company that you should be aware of:
- Working with such smart people can lead to ""imposter syndrome"" - feeling that you aren't good enough or don't belong.
- With great freedom to manage your own work, you have to be able to thrive in ambiguity. You won't get a list of work items at Google.
- When everyone else has that same freedom, ""herding the cats"" requires a lot of people skills. You can't fall back on management to give diktats and expect that people will fall into line.
The only true negative is the very high political level of group-think. If you are right-leaning, middle of the road, or even slightly left-leaning politically, you may feel shouted down if you try to participate in the wide ranging internal forums by the dominating far left (but the solution to this is easy - just ignore the political nonsense).

Especially on the manager track, the size of organization you manage seemed to matter more than how good of a manager you were.  In many parts of the org, it became impossible to get the promotion to the next level unless you had a manager who was really good about helping you carve out space to manage a large organization within their org.

This manager ruled through confusion and an iron fist, most likely because it was clear that the entire team was smarter than this manager. I had no clear direction on my role, or even what the outcome of the project the team was working on, no matter how many times I asked. I quickly became bored and frustrated and soon realized that I was not learning anything new, and the transferrable skills I did bring were not being utilized. That's when I started looking outside the company,  and here is what I found at my new job: 25% increase in salary, 50% more vacation time and 150% increase in bonus target. Once I left, I realized just how old fashioned Google really is regarding Management, Performance Reviews, and other HR-related issues. Perf and Calibration were abandoned by most companies years ago because it doesn't work in identifying the best performers, but at Google it defines you forever. Lastly, during orientation the advice given to the Nooglers is ""don't be a jerk"". It turns out that I have never worked at a company that had more jerks than Google. The egos and arrogance I encountered were off the charts. It was easy to overlook when I liked what I was doing, but once I was put under the bad manager my eyes were opened to the ugly reality of working at Google.",Recognize and stop the empire building that's going on at the lower levels. Change the perf and calibration process and get rid of the people that allow the gaming of the system. The appearance of transparency is not really transparency.

OKRs connect individual results to BU (e.g. POPs) results, but that always felt limiting to me. After all, I didn't join Google just to help move People Operations forward! I wanted to help the broader company succeed, and that line of sight is hard to see in an organization so large. The OKRs could help with that - but reconfigure them so that individual results are mapped out to Google/Alphabet's results (not just the BU)."

Surrounded by smart researchers. Shuttle for commuting.,"Promotion process too arbitrary. I got extremely good ratings but still was passed over for far too long.  Promo still requires a ""launch"" with a right kind of metrics to impress the committee.

Bay Area too expensive. I'm leaving for Seattle -- it's expensive too, but it's *possible* to buy a condo/house there without a ridiculous commute. The past 5 years of price-doubling have prevented me from getting into the market even at my good software engineer salary. Priced out of market -- seriously. The people who can bear to live near work are married Google couples, new grads from India or China living together crammed into crappy small houses... or people who bought a place 5 years ago before $750k, 2 bedroom, 1200 sq ft houses became $1.5M.

My skills were note utilized; I couldn't get transferred onto the right teams where I could apply my Ph.D. research.","When someone like me gets Strongly Exceeds Expectations 3 times in a row (that's 1.5 years) it's high time for promotion. I'm leaving because I wasn't promoted from 4 to 5 despite long-term dedicated efforts to do so, whereas I have an offer for an L5-6 equivalent position in another major company. I would have stayed indefinitely otherwise. But now I realize that even if I get a promo soon, I'll only get a 6% raise (per policy) and it will still take a year for the RSU benefits to start catching me up to the next level comp.  Meanwhile I can get a 25% raise tomorrow by jumping ship. **Note that the delay between ""prove you're performing at the next level for a year (or much more)"" combined with ""RSUs awarded later on, total comp will catch up eventually..."" means that I'll be underpaid for 2 years or so if I stay.**

This matters since, while waiting for promo, I've been priced out of the housing market. My friends who are married with a spouse at Google are house-hunting, and younger ones are living together in 5 bedroom places. I'm married and need some privacy, my wife doesn't work, so there's no way to live close to work and I'm sick of commuting. If I had made it to L5 when I applied I'd afford to be staying, but now it's too late.

Also, when I have specialized skills from my Ph.D. and I'm constantly getting moved to projects that aren't making use of those skills, it's annoying. ""Headcount"" issues on super-appropriate teams for me kept me out of the positions where I would be most useful to Google by applying my Ph.D. work. So I'm taking my talent elsewhere.

All in all, I was greatly disappointed by:
 * Extremely slow time-to-promo (due to higher-ups cancelling projects... out of my control).
 * Advanced to lead a team of 6 people, at only level 4 (a ""junior"" role where explicit team leadership is very uncommon) and yet still the promo process didn't value my contribution, even though my manager and director did.
 * Cost of living in the Bay Area, and resultant time to commute (Gbus was great but it got old after 5 years)
 * Stuck on wrong projects, due to headcount issues/timing/18-months-on-team-before-transfer policy. And bait-and-switch for my initial team due a ""headcount problem"" where I didn't get into the expected team in the first place.
 * Not valued for my Ph.D. speciality skills, but simply as a software engineer. I'm moving to a company that needed *me* in particular, and I'm joining a particular team. This generic SWE-hiring with random team matching is insulting."

- The uplifts on quota are absurd. 100%, 150% increases over what that territory did last year.

Transfers require good performance reviews, which means everyone moves along until they land in something which doesn't fit their skills, at which point they can never leave.  There's no bad fit, just bad employees.

Advice to Management 
> DISRUPT. Ignore short term numbers in favor of long term industry disruption. 
> ALLOW. They hire the best and brightest so trust them to do their job however that may be.

- Perks and culture. As a result of the success fo the company. There is a very strong sense of job security. Food and all of the other perks continue to lead the industry. 
- You will make some of your best friends here. Most people who get through the doors of Google are truly ""good"" people, and those who are not often find themselves getting 'managed out' in one way or another. 
- The SMB Sales/Google Marketing Solutions Org hires some of the smartest recent college grads for their entry level roles - great opportunity to hone skills and grow with the company. 
- My experience has given me great career growth outside of Google, and it is a great place to be at the forefront of the digital media industry and its future.","- Perks are great, but don't let that fool you - after your 3 months of organized training is over, you will be so caught up by the never-ending internal metrics tracking your every move. You will have no time to use the nap pod that all of your friends love to ask you about 
- SMB Sales/Google Marketing Solutions is seen as a ""younger"" organization within the company and within overall Google sales. It is very difficult to rise the ranks, as this reputation follows you throughout your career journey. 
- A significant amount of account strategists and direct sales employees within the organization are extremely unhappy. Many are absolutely miserable. The work is mundane and people are constantly complaining as the organization continues to operate across the same metrics, incentives, and programs that it has been for almost 10 years. You will not hear a lot about this, as employees always feel the pressure of saying that they are happy at one of the 'best companies in the world to work for'. No one wants to be the one who is complaining about problems at Google to their friends outside the company.
- Perks, culture, and company reputation will keep you way past your expiration date. You will find out you should have moved on way too late.  
- The hiring bar has severely decreased as the company gets larger. Mediocre employees are hired based on industry experience, but have a very hard time ramping up to Google's way of doing things, and are often unable to keep up. 
- The process of performance reviews and promotions will at one way or another negatively impact you. It is one of the most dramatic processes, especially in this organization. There are long lists of people 'waiting' to rise to the next level in the company as people are ranked, forcing you to wait your turn in a slowly-moving cycle of burnt out individuals waiting for their recognition. People sit in the same role, burnt out and unhappy, waiting for their chance to hopefully make the next cycle's cut. Promotions lead to generous pay raises, but your job and experience stays the same in most situations.","Focus on understanding the challenges of your employees and push new innovation to help mitigate their issues. Management is also waiting for their next promotion - always taking the safest route with minimal change or disturbance. Focus hiring and promoting people who are talented and have a passion for sales, and avoid those who are just looking to take any job they can at a company like Google. The company is one of the largest in the world. It is no longer the sexy tech company it once was. Be transparent about growth opportunities from the start, and set clear expectations around where one can expect their career path to grow."

I leave knowing that what I worked on had true impact on others personally and professionally. I was lucky to have the mentors and champions I did.,"It is a sink or swim environment. Wonderful perks but they are there to keep you at work longer. People don't leave jobs, they leave managers. Google has a long way to go when it comes to training their managers effectively and actually making sure they represent the initiatives Google is in the news for such as Psychological Safety and Unconscious Bias. I went from amazing managers and sponsors to the worst manager ever. Just because a manager takes a course doesn't mean they have adopted the lessons taught. 

I suffer from a disability that is episodic and goes into remission at times. At the end of my time with Google, despite needs for accommodations due to my disability, my manager declined a request to work in a quieter and more private work space. HR took their time.  In addition, I was only allowed to work from home on Fridays. I was also penalized on my performance review for not being able to work in a more visible work space. This is important to note. I went from a high performing employee for 4+ years and then got sick  and within 3-4months was rated as a Needs Improvement by my manager who had only managed me for 3 months and the one before 5 months. At Google, your MANAGER has the final say on your performance review. Despite high ratings from everyone else, HR stands firm about letting the managers rating be the overall rating and override all other reviewers.

Google needs to understand that not all people work or learn the same way. Don't expect reasonable accommodations to be honored here. They took 6 weeks to respond to my drs note for a medically necessary accommodation. This is NOT a space if you have any type of disability especially cognitive or mental ones. There is a whole internal email disability group which provides a community for many of us who are struggle from our disability and not our jobs. However, no one from HR has bothered to address the true struggles that people with disabilities are facing.","It is not enough to just have programs on Psychological Safety and Unconscious Bias. Google needs to do a better job vetting and deciding who moves into a management role. I loved my job and I was great at it. The change to two new managers in less than 6 months was not only too much for me to take but for our team of 10. Manager survey reports are enough. What are the chances that the managers report is going to tell you that the managers you put in place last lacked so little empathy, compassion, and support and was so goal driven that they pushed 2 of their 10 reports onto medical leave. Google, you are losing tons of top talent because people don't fit into a particular mold. The truth of the matter is that sooooo much top talent can be saved with very minor accommodations. There needs to be an Advocate for those who have disabilities to mediate with HR or managers when needed. 
So many managers are caught up in their day to day that despite being educated on Unconscious Bias .... they just can't see their biases because they are so caught up on performance. You can't know what you don't know just like many of these managers can't see their biases. You can't see what you can't see and a short workshop or online course is not enough to make you see it, identify it and change it. Google, you need someone to be identifying and challenging managers in real life to challenge their biases and to come in and advocate for those with disabilities. Many other companies already have this role and it is truly unfortunate that a large company such as Google at the forefront of so much does not.

In part due to the numerous acquisitions, that allowed people that would have never been hired by Google to join the company.

Being at the mercy of Perf to get promoted. If a direct manager likes an employee, then it's a walk in the park, otherwise prepare to be stonewalled or have to resort to some serious brown-nosing to get ahead. Also, leveling-up gets super competitive due to the large size of the company. Transferring teams is a challenge, so most employees grin and bear it for a couple of years, or leave the company. It's hard for outsiders to understand, but this happens to a lot of Nooglers, and ""re-Noogler"" events are done  for employees that complete their first year. It's unfortunate, but after the ""rainbow-colored glasses"" come-off most new employees burn-out . Google seems to bring out the workaholic in people.
 
Politics among teams and Orgs slow everything down, often leading to delayed launches, buggy releases and zero transparency. Also, there's an awfully large amount of bad managers.

It's safe to say, depending on what team you're on, that'll shape your experience significantly. I did have one team I loved, one that I hated and one that was just ok so i actually a well rounded outlook of Google. 

Pros is google overall cares for its people but it's the management that either keeps that up or messes it up. 

You will work with the most brilliant people ever which is usually a good thing but it can also be a bad thing which I'll discuss below. 

My work life balance was also dependent on the team you're on. On one team I could barely catch up and another, I was barely working 20 hours a week but did my job well. 

Of course the perks are great so I don't need to get into that.","On the ""worst"" team of the three, my team was rediculously micro managed to the point that we would get in trouble for leaving our desks. I got talked two twice and the third time I got pulled into a room with my manager telling me I had to work at my desk even though I was the top performer on the team. There were major trust issues. 

Management is truly hit or miss. My first manager was literally in meetings all day and no one got face time. He ended up leaving because he ended up not liking it anymore. Second manager I loved and the team was perfect but she ended up transferring due to how she felt she was treated. The new manager was terrible, pulled down the morale and 3 people transferred out after 3 months. Third manager was brand new and no one trusted her. 3 people left within 3 months. Good management is hard to come by. 

Competitiveness runs rampant to the point that people will steel your work. If you bring it up like I did after seeing it happen to me 3+ times, management told me that's the way Google grooms people and it makes people become competitive. 

You're surrounded by brilliant people but the imposter syndrome is strong at Google. The way performance reviews are set up, you always have to come up with random stuff to outdo yourself and make you look good. That's good to push you out of your comfort zone but bad because people start making up useless things to show they've been doing stuff. It's silly really. And this is why it's incredibly hard to get promoted is that you have to outdo yourself and outshine your peers. My peers before me have been at Google for 6+ years literally in the same role even though they work incredibly hard and smart. 

I suggest you do as much research as possible and Google why people leave or don't like working at Google so you see both sides.",

The dedicated smart people will actually try to make these ideas work, but the credit would be taken by someone else, or sometimes with others leaving a big mess, as I have seen several times.

Well, not at Google. You will have artificially created restraints in almost every aspect of your work.

Here is an example: readability. In order to being able to commit some code at Google you would need to have a ""readability"" in a language you're writing this piece of a code. It doesn't matter if you have 10 years of experience in that language. It doesn't matter if you have certificate from the company that developed this language. And in order to get readability you would need to write a lot of code in that language. Catch-22. Also, you would have to wait for a pretty long time in the readability queue in order to just start with process. You fill like you lost all the experience you had before with this language. Somebody who has readability and has less experience in this language than you will have power over you. You would have to persuade this other person that your code is OK.

Hypocrisy. They still have courses at Google where they teach you that it is important to have a rest, it is important to manage your energy, it is important to work when you are excited and energized and not work when you're not. This is why they have all those massage chairs. It used to be the company that valued all this. It all changed. I saw my manager writing in 2am and then writing in 6am again. Manager sets an example for it's subordinates and this example is terrible. I also remember my manager writing email about his current state that he is sick. At the same email he tells that ""he will do his best to do some work"". At the same time this same manager tells everybody else that ""if you're sick - go home and take a rest and don't work"". I lost respect for my manager long time ago.

They want you to deliver results as soon as possible and yet they don't give you the ability to do it. Instead of JUST DOING IT you would have to write design docs with the future possible architecture (which will always be different because we can't predict software development) and persuade people who have more power than you. Those people will do their best to make sure you don't just start working on your code. You would have to pass several rounds of this absurd.

They told me it is very important to predict how much time it would take to finish the project. I asked them what is the technique to predict unpredictable and got no answer in return. They told me it is very important to make sure you did your project as close to your predictions as possible. I asked them what stops people from deliberately giving very large estimates, completing a project sooner and just do nothing for the rest of the time. I got no answer in return. I completely lost respect this company. This is absurd. The management don't think about what they are doing and why. They don't think about their own behavior and they own words.",

- Technology of course: It's great using Gmail/Google for Work products (much better than Microsoft suite that we're all used to outside of Google), and there are high quality cameras/screens in every conference room for meetings on Google Hangouts, making it very easy to work with remote teams
- Pay and bonuses: Usually much better vs. other companies, especially since they offer stock units that vest over time and Google stock is worth a lot (though I did hear from other Googlers that they could get paid a lot more at other companies? not sure what they're referring to...). 
- All in all, it's working for Google, which in itself is a pro and ""cool"" to many!!","- Very competitive atmosphere: People take credit for others' work and there have been many cases where this has happened across several teams. These people want to look better to senior leadership/get more hires/justify their roles. 
- Different experience dependent on what team you're on: Dynamics vary a lot. Often, your boss must be vocal enough or well liked in order for you to succeed (as the person below them) since you have no access to upper leaders.  
- Poor Management & Leadership: Just really bad in a lot of cases and don't really know what's going on. Lack of product knowledge and it's very obvious. 
- Promotions are selective: ""Favorites"" will often be easily promoted, when others may deserve it more. There is only a certain # of people who can be promoted every cycle. 
- At times, feels like a sexist environment for women: Males favored, listened to more, and ""boys club"" mentality at management level.
- ""Flat"" organization but very hierarchical: Try to hire smart, experienced people in at the low level, meaning you must do everything on your own and feels like you're alone on an island of 1 without help or anyone to manage/hire in below you. Managers are usually people who have been at Google for a long time, and they are the ones with access to the senior leadership teams. 
- Hiring: Takes a long time. They say they only hire ""smart people""; however, the company is so big now, that's really impossible... many employees are not as smart or cool as Google advertises. 
- Unwilling to allow transfers to other offices: If you like Mountain View, great! If you do not like Mountain View, which most people do not, good luck with trying to transfer offices and stay in your current role. Internal transfers are also not as easy as advertised. 
- Bureaucracy: It's a huge company. Don't expect it to be all roses or feel like a small, fun company.

Within this role and organization, you receive a great deal of respect and prestige from your clients, as they look to you for strong business guidance. The pay is very competitive, and if you have a supportive manager, the potential to gain merit raises annually is very high (as are the stock refreshes). The company provides many internal trainings for those interested in personal development, and the opportunity to travel to another office in another city/country is readily available on a quarterly basis. Most importantly, it's some of the best people you will ever work with. Aside from the odd, few people who inexplicably make it through hiring, the people who work within the sales org at Google are strong team players, optimistic, creative, strategic, hard-working, quirky and down-to-earth individuals.","The global business org at Google struggles with its flat organizational structure; it can be difficult to get promoted or to have your work acknowledged in a very competitive, self-promoting culture. Don't believe everything you read in the press about how fantastic Google work culture is. Although the HR department has made multiple attempts to improve the promotion structure at Google, it can be near impossible to navigate all of the appropriate politics to gain a promotion. Furthermore, a promotion in the sales org at Google does not necessarily mean an increase in responsibility or a title change. Employees usually work in roles 1-2 levels above them in order to first demonstrate that they are worthy of promotion. In this same vein, the opportunities for growth are VERY few within this org, and you often find people moving from industry to industry (within the sales org) to keep their day-to-day interesting. There is a huge bottleneck for middle management to make their way into leadership positions. Most importantly, the leadership within the sales org is severely lacking. Leadership makes decisions well removed from the sales organization itself (and its employees) and often work like politicians to further their own careers, rather than improve the larger organization itself.",

The experience: having Google's name on your resume, building connections with others and working at one of the best and innovated companies","You do not get all the perks. For example, team off-sites. It does suck when your colleagues are raving about how they really bonded during the team's off-site, and you can't really relate. Sense of connecting is really important at a work place, and sense you are restricted from having that even if your work excels your peers can't fully scope it because the lack of connection. 

You don't get all the knowledge. You are blocked from participating in Grow classes that the rest of your team gets. If you want to compete you must go out of your way and pay for classes, that your team members (sometimes) get for free. They are constantly learning and growing with ease and accessibility. While you're juggling to keep up, while being financially stable in this ridiculously economy. 

You do learn from your colleagues. Well, the nice ones but (yes, even at Google) there are mean and very mean people. Even management is mean. Not everyone at Google is Googley (that's a fact). Especially, once they see your red badge. Once they see red it is like the respect is gone. Some do treat TVCs as though they are slaves whose knowledge is mediocre and opinions don't matter. From my experience thus far, Google consist of 15% genuinely nice, 20% nice, 35% mean, and 30% really mean people. Oh, and the majority of the 15% are TVCs. 

My experience: You work your butt off and are doing the same work as your full-time teammates for below market pay with very little to sometimes no recognition. Your opinions do not matter. They only bought you on to do the hard slave labor.","Google please change how you treat your TVCs. We aren't just slaves. We are smart and hardworking people.

If you want to grow, you have to seek out opportunities and prove that your worth. This keeps you motivated.
- Tons of interesting projects. There is no dearth of challenging projects that will keep you interested for years. Mobility within the company is easy as long as you are good performer.
- You get to work with some very smart people and that makes you perform a notch above.
- Management is intentionally less involved in an engineer's life and this avoids micromanagement, bias and single point of failure. This goes with point #1. You are free to define what can be done in your domain (of course you have to sell it).
- a lot of basic infra exists and is exceptional. So you don't have to spend too much time on your ""means"" to the end.
- pay for performance: if you are a good performer, you are taken care of.
- needless to say, perks are amazing.
- at Google you will learn a lot of things and you will learn it from the best. IMHO, I don't see a lot of engineers wanting to learn once they graduate, even from undergrad. They want to be person that build the next biggest thing. It's great if you truly have that skill.","- Google is a big company. So there are going to be winners and losers when it comes to career growth. Due to the high hiring bar, most people who don't win are smart people as well and their experience sours. This place is optimized to avoid false positives in every step and false negatives are inevitable. At least when you get promoted, you can feel good that you have truly done something.

- You have to have skill to find impactful areas or projects or start one in order to grow fast. A lot of people can't or don't want to do that. They want it lying there in a platter in front of them (I don't mean this disrespectfully. I have been there). This is why smaller companies or startups look attractive. It's easier to grow in a less competitive place and there is nothing wrong in wanting that.
 In my experience, a lot of people who say Google is boring and young & smaller companies are those that are good at building things and solving problems that a thousand other engineers can solve. They just want a place where it hasn't been solved. At google, a lot of your basic services and infra are built. So the problems to solve get substantially more difficult and requires some lateral thinking as well. Again, no disrespect. There are lot of people out there, including me, who would like interesting problems handed over to us.

- in a place of this size, you have to navigate some political issues.

- in critical systems like search, you can just push new things (rightfully so).  It's a process and you have to convince that your feature can be used by a billion people. I'm sure every company would do this.",

You often don't get special recognition for doing your job, and there's no guarantee that you'll end up at a job with Google full time - it's all based on business need. This isn't Google's fault.

Basically, they're incentivized to get customers to do as many actions as possible - whether or not those actions are actually good for the customer.

Great location","I saw a lot of hierarchical nonsense/ the promotion process seems to be very draining
Horrible communication between the intern team and the interns (there are just too many interns to be perfectly honest)",Only expand the internship program if you can handle it. It's not worth sacrificing the quality.
3321,"Oct 5, 2015","""Great company, but your mileage WILL vary.""",Systems Administrator,"New York, NY",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,I worked at Google ,"* Google has, bar none, some of the best office schemes I've ever seen. Their conference room layouts make a lot of sense, and the designs and liveliness pouring through those walls were on another level. 

* There are tons and tons AND TONS of teams at Google working on close to anything that you can think of, technical or not, and transferring between them is actually encouraged as long as you're on good standing performance-wise.

* Feedback is taken very seriously at Google. It's paramount to their culture and it shows: the Food department cares a lot about turning out high-quality food, People Ops does everything they can to make the employee experience a happy one, etc. Even though it's kind-of a talking piece now, the TGIF sessions with Larry, Sergey and top management are unprecedented.

* The food is quite good most of the time. Some of it's restaurant-quality, even. (It highly depends on the cafe you go to and the food you typically eat.)

* Aside from a tech startup, I can't think of any other place that's on the bleeding edge of technology at this scale. Google is highly, highly experimental, almost to a fault. (More on that in the ""Cons."")

* Their benefits are really generous for a large org. They're not insanely so compared to others like them, but all of the basics (and then some!) are covered. 

* If you like free stuff, Google will bury you with it over time. I didn't work there very long but somehow got two backpacks, a few shirts and a hoodie. Interns get way more stuff, though.","A lot of the cons below are projections of my experience at Google. Do a TON of research on the role you'll be applying for. Find people on LinkedIn. Scour reddit. Learn as much as you possibly can about what you'll be doing to try and prepare for what's to come.

* Your experience at Google will largely depend on your team and/or manager. If you join a bad team and/or a bad manager, you'll be in for a rough 12 months (the minimum amount of time that's usually required to transfer out.)

* ANYTHING you do or create outside of work is owned by Google, regardless of whether you used their resources or not to do it. This could be a HUGE issue for you if you contribute heavily to open-source and/or like to build side projects. Google's People Ops **do** look out for people doing this too.

* The compensation is okay depending on where you're coming from, but salary is practically non-negotiable (stock units are more flexible, though) and might not even be competitive depending on your area. Lots of funded startups and finance shops pay significantly better for the same level of experience. Additionally, compensation doesn't scale relative to growth. One could double their salary or more within the same amount of time it takes to get from mid-range to senior at Google.

* Almost everything that an engineer at Google uses on a daily basis is home-grown and maintained by other Googlers. Much of this tooling is incredibly complicated and takes months to warm up to. This could be a MAJOR brain drain to consider depending on your career path and/or whether you're thinking of staying at Google long-term. (That said, some of the tools were pretty good, though I usually preferred third-party alternatives for many of the others I worked with.)

* Most of the sexy projects that makes Google Google are in Mountain View, and if you really want to take your career at Google seriously, you'll eventually have to move out there. Living costs in the Bay are insane and show no signs of restoring sanity any time soon.

* Despite having all of the infrastructure to support it, remotely working is generally discouraged by most teams. That said, many, MANY meetings are done completely or partially with Hangouts and Google's solution for accessing internal resources from public endpoints is probably the best there is. 

* Their interview process is generally terrible. Engineers at Google generally don't like to interview and/or provide feedback, so the interview experience for potential candidates varies wildly across the board. The process also takes a really long time. It took me about four months to get to the offer stage; apparently, that's normal there. (To put this into perspective, I've worked at places that took a week from cold start to signed offer; they can't possibly not be losing talent from these insane delays.)

* I don't remember seeing more people glued to their phone or laptop in a single workplace before coming here. It seems like almost everyone travels while glued to their phone here. It's maddening. 

* Most interviews are focused almost entirely on technical merit. This makes it (much) more likely for engineers with strong technical skills but (very) weak social skills to make it through the cracks. If you're more outgoing and ""extroverted,"" this might bother you. (It bothered me to no end.)

* There's lots of exciting work being done at Google, but more exciting work usually means even more operational work. A lot of extremely capable people get slotted into doing that sort of work. Do as much research as you can on your role to give you an idea of what you're getting into.

* Technical merit is placed above all else as an engineer. Because this is a significant determinant in promotion decisions, a lot of people spend a lot of time doing ""complex and impactful"" work at the expense of things like documentation or maintainability. As you might imagine, this leads to a lot of reinvented wheels and deprecation. (It doesn't help that every project seemingly *has* to have a name to it that might or might not have anything to do with the project that describes it.)

* Work-life balance HIGHLY depends on your team. In my experience, people at Google that spent a lot of time working after-hours did so on their own volition (for better or worse). Management never pressured me to work more than I wanted to; in fact, they've had to tell people to ease up!","You really need to pay your people better. The market's catching up to you. Discouraging remote workers made more sense in 2003 than it does now. Aside from that, a lot of Googlers seem to be happy and proud of being Googlers and I can't blame them. Building a 50,000+ person company that isn't a behemoth of drones is pretty hard to pull off!"

1. Opportunity to get on high impact and/or high reach projects, whether it's user or advertising products. When you announce something at Google, people pay attention, something that is definitely gratifying as a marketer.
2. Overall, most cross functional teams are pretty cool, whether it be working with BD, engineering, product, sales, or PR. 90% of the time one can learn a great deal from colleagues of a different group.","The company is huge. Getting things done is an increasing problem, and wading through many layers of bureaucracy, approvals, executive changes-of-mind are a constant challenge that impedes one from actually shipping -- even on the business side.","Build smaller, more agile teams and don't be afraid to stand up to engineering or product leadership.

Google's increasing scale is causing problems. Some parts of infrastructure are so complex that no one can see the whole picture. Duplicated work and missed requirements happen a lot. As the machine grows larger and there are more parts, the scope of individual responsibility moves further from having real customer impact.

Also I disagree with the high level direction of the company. In the last few years senior management has developed and worsened a trend of killing or crippling beloved products.

The department is dysfunctional, understaffed and lacks basic process, controls and systems support that you'd expect at such an established company.  It's Oracle version stopped being supported; Financials don't tie across systems; there's a complete lack of governance around core processes so every department, manager, leader does something entirely different (and guess what, no one gets along or agrees).

If you can land on a happy team, it can be a happy ride. But there's limited career growth, you're getting Tier 3 finance skills (because when so much cash shows up, no one cares about a model) and the rest of the organization views you as the weakest link. If it's your way to get in, great--but don't view Finance as a long-term success path. It's a cess-pool of repetitive, boring work that Google doesn't have the discipline or the patience to optimize, outsource or eliminate.  You will feel like you're wasting your life.

That it's the first thing mentioned is kind of analogous to people first mentioning ""good weather"" when talking about the pros California.

-Author talks at Google are good opportunities to meet authors, and offer nice perspectives from outside the tech bubble.  I need to take advantage of this more.

-Engineering culture.  I've worked at places before that treated engineers as more of a means to an end, instead of involving them more in the process.  Nice role reversal here, though it probably still needs some balance.

-Looks good on your resume

-Good place to start your career, though be careful because you can't take much with you (or you will want to recreate tech on the outside when you get out).

-20% time still exists (depends on the team)

-work-life balance (depends on the team)

-Can become too comfortable and insular and not challenging, which can hurt your career later on.  Don't get too comfortable or you'll get trapped here.","-Coworkers talk about the food endlessly, like it's the best and central part of their day.  Because it is.

-Lots of NIH and Google-specific libraries which folks can't take with them when they leave.  The outside world operates very differently and with different technologies, and people won't learn much of that here unfortunately.

-Lack of freedom to choose technologies.  A lot of solutions exist on the outside, but there's often a homegrown competitor that we're forced to use, so it will make that other team look good (lots of folks write libraries and services just to get promoted).

-No Node.js support in production.  This is especially painful for aqui-hires because many startups these days use Node.  Then they find they need to re-write everything to integrate with Google.

-Checkin + code review process is super bloated, anal retentive, and obsessive.  This slows down development time considerably.  This is especially painful for aqui-hires, where no one on the team has readability, so you have to make friends within Google just to get your code checked in.  Really, really frustrating and the feeling that productivity has gone down immensely.

-Still not a good environment for frontend engineers.  If you even hint that you like JavaScript and CSS, people will look at you like you have brain damage.  Not a lot of the engineering culture values FE work, although that's a self-admitted problem that they're trying to change.

-Fiscal irresponsibility.  Hiring rate within the last few years has been out of control and unsustainable.  There is a boom time now, but this is going to hurt and result in many layoffs when the next crash happens.

-Engineering culture (also listed as a pro above).  Specifically non-frontend engineering.  This is reflected in the ridiculous interview process.  It would be good to get more diversity of thought and perspectives, not just a hard-line engineering perspective.  So many decisions are based on quantitative data alone, which is a mistake if a company wants to push the boundaries and wants to be innovative.

-Entitlement and elitism.  It's not everyone of course.

-High cost of living around main campus.  You may think you're getting paid a lot, but the cost of living in the area matches that salary.",Find ways to keep challenging engineers.

The sense of competition is keen, not necessarily because of the formal review process, but just because hanging around some of the smartest engineers in the world every day can be intimidating. I frequently encountered coworkers who, like me, felt themselves to be ""the dumbest Googler."" No one wants to write inferior code or to be thought of as doing so, and for me, the pressure in a public-facing role was even greater. Politically speaking, the culture leans hard to the left and as a conservative Christian, I sometimes felt marginalized by the conversation taking place on emails, G+, and in the office. Still, my immediate team members were always friendly and easy to get along with and i wouldn't trade my time at Google for any other company.","Don't forget that engineering culture made the company what it is--not only internally, but also externally.

2. The legend of ""developer come up with ideas and had freedom to execute"" does not exist.

 - Parties: Halloween and Christmas mean big fun elaborate parties, and there are lower key events like stargazing parties too.

 - Transportation: don't get me wrong, bay area traffic sucks, but being able to take a shuttle instead of driving gives me a good opportunity to get reading done without having to worry about transfers or other public transit snags.

 - Stock awards with value: sure, I missed the high risk high reward boat on this, but I probably would have bought Google stock even if I never worked here.

 - One hell of a rubber stamp for my resume in my eventual future job finding endeavors.","Google is inevitably becoming bigger and more corporate as time goes on.  Sometimes leadership will make a decision that seems only to benefit the company to the detriment of employees or users.  If you step back, everything is still great overall so it's hard to complain, but it can be troubling at times.  Whenever that happens I just hug my stock real tight and remember that I can always bail if things actually start going south.  So far nothing's made me consider leaving.",

In many of those reorgs, people weren't being recognized as individuals, but more just cogs that need to be put in place for Google to build the next $10BN business.  Google talks a good talk and employees believe management.  However, over the years employee's expectations have become so high, that when an individual is in a poor job situation, they feel like Google owes them something better.  So you have people who sit in a role/team/dept thinking the situation will get better or that management has a good plan, and they'll be fine once they give it a few months.  In reality, that person is either overqualified for the role or a bad fit, but are too complacent to change.  Many employees can't even fathom leaving Google, so they sit there and hope it works out and will figure it out once the new dream role opens up.  But that doesn't happen and so they wait it out until the next reorg.  The cycle continues.","Performance reviews: make them real-time.  Good employees get lost in the shuffle when their manager structure changes in every reorg (For example, in my 10 years, I had 49 job classification changes, even though I only changed jobs technically once).

This means your coworkers will likely be very interesting and fun, and you'll probably enjoy the office environment immensely. You'll learn a lot. The hours are very flexible and the company takes the notion of work-life balance as it applies to the workday very seriously (though there's a dark reason for this). And the perks are second to none. Compensation is also quite competitive as you rise through the ranks.

And the food! I still dream about the food.

It's a great place to build a stable career if you love coding but aren't super-entrepreneurial and don't make tons of contributions to open source projects (see the cons for why these would be issues). The workplace environment is often replicated, but nobody else has matched it yet.","The cons are flipped versions of the pros: Google hires very smart people and then puts them in fairly mundane roles. They used to try to take your preferences into account when allocating; they seem to do much less of this as they've grown. If you're at all purpose-driven, you'll eventually become restless at work, looking for something with more meaning than the project you're on. You could potentially 20% something, but that notion has always applied more to some groups than others, and the company has tended to downplay it in recent years.

More disturbingly, there's a severe opportunity cost to your side projects: their position is that everything that you do in your personal time belongs to them, although that is not what the employment agreement says and would be an unenforceable position in California. They instead get around this by suggesting that everything that touches the web or mobile (and perhaps the desktop as well) is competitive with them. There's a committee that will examine ideas, but it appears to be moribund.

Google has grown tremendously, and systematized to the point where it's a large machine, needing an increasing number of cogs to keep the engine running. The culture has been eroding recently because the company hasn't been able to reconcile it with its growth, and because the company has sidetracked from its core mission and thrown resources at ""me-too"" projects such as Google+. I predict that this will hurt the company's outlook in the long term, as most of its revenue generation still comes from relatively few core activities which are exposed to market and competitive risks. As it becomes less entrepreneurial, it becomes less able to diversify into new areas, and thus becomes less resilient. I would expect this to take 5-10 years to become apparent (the market would need to shift in a way that causes one of their pillars to collapse), which means that it may not be an issue for most people considering it now.

One other thing I've found is that while they care collectively about their engineers a great deal, they're generally not very willing to go out on a limb to make individuals happy. Food and facilities people are the exception, as they do often take engineers' feedback into account.","Recapture the entrepreneurial spirit and let the creative people you hired innovate.
Stop trying to clone Facebook and focus on what you're good at.
Diversify your revenue streams, or the market will eventually smack you."

When I need assistance from another engineer or another team, I typically get quick and effective help.  Office politics exist, but compared to anywhere else I've worked they're not a problem.

- Compensation / perks:  I'm very satisfied with my compensation.  The assorted perks are pretty valuable as well -- the food and fitness facilities are my favorites.

- Work/life balance: From reading other reviews here it seems that experiences in this area vary.  But mine have been excellent.  I rarely work over 40 hours a week, and when I do it's because I personally feel engaged by what I'm working on, never because of pressure from my manager or team lead.  I almost never check work emails during evenings or weekends, and when I come in to the office in the morning I don't find that they've been emailing me during that period.  I actually have gotten gentle pushback from my team lead when I asked if he could log in from home later in the evening to review/approve a change I wanted to submit.","- Impostor syndrome:  The flip side of working with so many smart and effective people is that it can be difficult to recognize your own value; if you're used to being the smartest guy in the room and suddenly you're surrounded by people who are at or above your ability, that can be a bit of a blow to the ego.  I eventually worked through this, but it took the better part of a year.

- Slow ramp-up:  One of the drivers of impostor syndrome for me was that it took me a lot longer to find my footing and get effective here than at other jobs.  Some of that is on me for not asking more questions, but I think more proactive support from leadership might have helped.  The environment at Google is very unique and there's a lot to learn before an engineer can get things done.

Flawed leveling/stack ranking process inhibits growth, opportunities to transfer, and eventually impacts sense of self-worth and work ethic (burnout is inevitable as mentioned).

Re-orgs are every 6 months, delaying/killing career traction. Layoffs do happen here, but company keeps it quiet.
Culture isn't for everyone: very snobby, often distrusting - company culture outside of walls is face value-only. Peers are collaborative only for promotions sake. Lots of bureaucracy and conformity, very corporate culture. Poor camaraderie outside of office.
Terrible internal systems. Proprietary Google CRM is a joke.
Transfer packages are terrible; HR always finds ways to negate merit increases when transferring by lowering salary, relocation packages are bare minimum (but most people here come from money, so that's ok I guess).

Throw an ineffective HR team in the mix and it is actually not a very supportive or pleasant place to work. I worked in a group that was dominated by men who actively did not like women. My male boss actually stated in a 1:1 with me once that he though several recent promotions were to fill some sort of ""promote women quota"" and that some of the women promoted did not actually deserve it based on their performance or skills. He actually said this to me, a woman. I did mention this to my HRBP and her response was ""do you want me to do something about that?"" A completely inappropriate response. Only young white men from top level universities and very masculine women were hired into our group, I was reorganized into the group my second year at Google and was shocked and disturbed by the environment on the team i joined. Work life balance was a joke and the only appreciation and recognition I received was from the  internal client groups I supported. I would not recommend working at Google to anyone and would say that women in particular need to think long and hard before going to work there. I think there is a lot of bullying, bias and harassment happening in the group I was in and HR should know about this as many people have raised it and no action towards improvements are being taken.",The HR team needs to be stronger and take appropriate action on items raised to them.

Lots of technical folks everywhere you turn.","There is very little emphasis on customers.
the majority of folks who work here are motivated by two things: better resume, and tech stuff that one ups other techies.

As a rather high ranking techie from half way across the world, these folks are not at all what I expected in terms of caliber.
Communication, people management, keeping a cool head, these things are not common here, and if you have them, they are not appreciated here.

This place is a mecca for folks that can't relate to others very well, but are very technically savvy.

Before you come here there are a few things you need to know:
1) most folks come here because they want to be happy
2) aside from the common knowledge that if you are presently at (be careful of used to work at) Google then you are technically smarter than others
3) Once you leave Google, people will think it was because you couldn't cut it, not because you were amazing. the only way to go is to either A) start your own company (not very common as there is not a focus on customers) B) get poached (very common), but after you have been poached everyone will still think you couldn't cut it at the big Goog.
4) most folks are happy because of 3 things:
 A) finding a mate (not very likely at Goog, unless you are hetero female, then game on, except most females here intimidate the guys... lol)
 B) making money (yep, you can do that here as well, ironically they don't pay that well for the area: IE you can 3x that in IT Finance or startups, or 2X in places like netflix; not to promote netflix, but they are very interesting if you are heavily motivated by the mulah)
 C) making a difference in the world (not super common here)

I know a lot of people who are only happy when talking to other people about their career because they work at Goog, but have pretty much put their life on hold, and their happiness on hold to be here.


Honestly, only work here if you live here.
Do not travel to work at Google.
It doesn't work out, and everyone ends up leaving to find a mate, more money, 
Do not move away from family to be here.

Basically work here if you have no other options.
If your people skills or business skills are to weak to affect folks, and you are OK not finding anyone special for a few years, and you are OK with really long hours, work here.
It is hella good bragging rights to most folks, but once you get high enough in the tech world, it can be a negative.


Actually I should share this as well.
the best people at google get poached (startups, other tech companies, etc...)
the worst get canned
all the people who can fake it stay
the people that stay hire other people just like them
There are a sea of shitty people growing at Google, beware them, and if one of them is your manager, transfer or leave ASAP, lest you find out the #1 factor of job unhappiness. =)

All in all, if you live in the area, and are just starting your career, please dont let this scare you.
This is a great place if you are local, young (22-28), and not interested in finding a mate.

We have a great amount of resources at our fingertips.  With a couple of commands, I can run a service on thousands of machines worldwide.  We have access to pretty much what we need to do our job.

Because Google is involved in a large number of industries, there are plenty of opportunities abound to find something that you're interested in.  We are highly encouraged to move around the company.

The company really takes care of us professionally and personally.  The benefits are incredibly high.  My team has been on offsites to Tahoe, Vegas, and Hawaii in the last year.  The company creates an environment where you don't really want to leave campus.

Lastly, being on the inside and seeing all of the technology before it launches is really like seeing the future.  Some of the unannounced products that we're working on is science fiction.","There are many projects that get rejected or shutdown because they aren't Google-scale.  Any of these projects that gets rejected would be really successful if it was created by a startup.  This also means that the bar for launch is much higher.

I was astounded by the superiority complex numerous full-time ""Googlers"" had toward the temps, vendors, and contractors Google also employs.  This attitude also was exhibited toward employees who came to Google via acquisitions.  Google likes to stress the point of working on personal initiatives and projects.  This unknowingly resulted in the duplication of efforts between locations.  If it was discovered that a person in another location was working on a similar project, there was usually a meeting to compare initiatives.  If the projects were similar and your peers had seniority over you, you were forced to stop your work even after having invested months on it.  At other times co-workers actively stole project plans and claimed as their own.  On another occasion, one of my personal projects was ""taken over"" by a manager who thought my project would benefit their current initiative.  I was forced to stop work on my project as it had been transitioned to the manager's team.  That said, many of the people are actually quite wonderful.

I joined Google about a year ago after many years in mid-tier management consulting.  For me, it's been a refreshing return to work-life balance.  No, that doesn't mean I work 35 hr weeks.  I'm often at Google before 7am and sometimes stay past 7pm.  I work hard because I want to be the best in my profession, because I believe I should earn all those perks Google is famous for, and because my team, who want to be the best in their professions, are relying on me.

That said, I've never worked into the wee hours of the morning.  Every Saturday and Sunday you'll find me outside running or biking, not in the office.  I have a wonderful marriage, get 8 hrs sleep every night and am fortunate to be leaving a happy life. 

In contrast, my consulting career was full of 70 hr workweeks, travel away from my family, unbelievable levels of stress and piles of politics.  Maybe Google is also like this at the VP and SVP level, I'm not sure.  But I'm about half way up the so-called corporate ladder and, at least from my perspective, things are refreshingly balanced and authentic. Again, I'm only 1 year in so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt.  

The other myth I'd like to debunk (actually, it appears to already be long-before debunked) is that only ivy-grads can get into Google.  From what I've heard, this was more true 10 years ago.  But, I attended a small undergrad school you've probably never heard of and haven't been back to school since.  I think what Google is looking for is the same as any company: people with honest passion for their trade, who don't mind putting in some elbow grease to keep the company growing.","Let's be honest: Google spoils it's employees.  We're all fortunate to work here.  The thing I worry about most is whether I'm making a real difference.  Google has such a legacy, and such infinite resources, that it can be a little overwhelming trying to figure out if you're taking full advantage of the opportunity.  For example, I'm guessing that the job posting that started my career here had maybe 100 other applicants.  That's 100 people who could have done a better job if I feel like ""taking it easy"" today.  I worry about doing well enough here to continue he legacy built before me.",Larry does a great job as far as I can tell.  Keep it up.

Pay is decent, but not as good as elsewhere.","I'm used to startup culture, and I had a serious culture shock coming to Google.  Maybe it varies somewhat by team, but from my vantage point, engineering seemed very bloated and bureaucratic.  There is an obscenely long and restrictive ""style guide"" of programming rules that must be followed and company-wide banned language features that makes coding much less productive than I'm used to.  Code reviews sometimes become bickerfests and can drag on for weeks or months.  The allocation of engineers to teams is awful - my recruiter basically lied about what I would be working on, when I arrived I was assigned to a team and project that I had no interest in whatsoever, and there was nothing I could do about it except suck it up until I could leave.  My coworkers were extremely risk-averse and were far more concerned about breaking something that already worked than about making progress.  Also the culture is biased towards ""perfect"" engineering solutions, and just hacking to get something done is highly frowned upon.  This isn't always bad, and you can learn good programming practices and discipline, but unfortunately it just isn't always practical in the real world of deadlines and needing to make progress.

The worst part of all is that I never felt like my work mattered anyway to the success of the company.  I worked on various projects that my manager assigned (there wasn't much discretion in choosing things to work on, and the vaunted 20% time is just hype), and my manager had a lot of ""pet projects"" that he wanted done but didn't really have any great justification for why they should be done at all.

Anyway Google is a big company and managers and teams vary in quality.  I'm sure there are plenty of people who are much happier than me, but I also think my situation is hardly unique.","Don't assign engineers to projects before their start date and assume that the employee will be happy with whatever crappy project they are assigned to.

Unless you are in NYC or Mountainview, you will never be considered.","Figure out how to deal with the quarterly performance reviews. Someone shouldn't ""have to get"" a ""occasionally misses expectations"" to balance out a bell curve (it's true). Develop more opportunities/departments with all of your offices and not just NYC/CA. Better balance feedback and getting work done - too much time making Gen Y's feel ""special"" when they are not.

Before you make these massive re-orgs (the last one in 2012 has been a nightmare) make sure you are truly understanding the impact on your employees.

Many of your coworkers will be smart.  A few will be brilliant.,"Most of what you hear about working at Google is just hype.  The reality doesn't live up to it.

Shitty passive-aggressive middle management.

Systematically rewards only short term results, which leads to exponential compounding of code cruft.   I mean they give explicit instructions for calibration and promo to consider only demonstrable benefits of the last 6 months of work, and nothing earlier than that which had a delayed benefit.   So the rank and file are forced to be like shitty mutual fund managers obsessed with quarterly results, in contrast to the upper management's supposed long term focus.

When you start they flip a coin and if it comes up tails you are stuck in ads for years against your will.

20% time is a lie.  20% time is essentially unpaid overtime and if god forbid your 20% time takes a risk and fails you will be calibrated as if you had spent that time doing nothing.

Every creative idea is shot down in favor of the same old safe but inefficient crap.  All the projects come from the top down.  There is no bottom-up innovation in ads because they try to keep everyone 110% busy with top down mandates.   The company hasn't really innovated much in years.  All their fast growing products are acquisitions or ""me too"" and the ads infrastructure is bloated and ossified.

There's a lot of witness-tampering when it comes to peer reviews and stack ranks.   You aren't allowed to rate your experience working with a person.  You're supposed to somehow rate their entire accomplishment including stuff that you had nothing to do with.  And if your stack ranks differ greatly from your manager's opinion of the latter they will passive aggressively hint that it will be a reason for firing you.

Valve has a much better stack ranking system where people just rate their own experience working with a person and all feedback is anonymous.  Also unlike Valve, Google has no freedom of association with whatever projects you want to do.  It's all top-down mandates and selfish horse-trading by psychopathic middle managers.

I've read about the toxic culture that killed Microsoft and it sounds very similar to Google in my experience.  A lot of the managers were hired from outside the company and tracked their shitty culture in with them.  Perhaps that explains it.",Fix the incentive structures to reward behavior that furthers the long term interests of the company and the employees.  Fire managers that get bad Googlegeist results and promote from within.   Make all peer reviews anonymous.  Abolish calibration or force the cabal to write a justification for each score.  Don't take avoiding conflict to the extreme of being passive-aggressive and failing to communicate.

Restricted Areas: not all Google employees are treated equally around campus anymore and access is limited based on what you do for the company and what group you work in.

But receive no promise for their hard work and are unappreciated by management.  Management is not allowed to give temporary workers any type of feedback as to their performance and are unable to pull them aside to tell them they are doing a good job, nor room for improvement.","Place water fountains on the DC Floor.

I was followed around, and whenever I tried to work my co-workers would comment on the code I was writing as I wrote it (or whatever else would throw me off and prevent me from being able to concentrate). They also took workplace monitoring to a new extreme, because it seemed as though everyone around me could access my computer, see what I was doing, and cause my computer to lock up.

I was constantly pushed to interact with my co-workers and to ask questions, but each question asked was met with a non-answer and a dismissive attitude as though they were worried I'd use the answer to show them up.

- you get intrinsic enjoyment from writing code - even when asked to spend months coding something for reasons that are unclear or less than inspiring (like lack of planning, inter-group politics, inertia, etc.)
- you like reading code, doing code reviews, and having access to the entire source code of most google products. 
- you plan to work here for at least several years and like the idea of spending your first 3 to 6 months getting familiar with the large number of google-only systems, tools, libraries and coding practices that must be known  even before doing small internal projects - even though this knowledge will be mostly irrelevant outside of google. 
- if forced to choose, you would prefer a high salary, incredible benefits and job stability more than working on projects you care about.

There are relatively few Pros that survived my first 2 months here and that I'll miss when I leave. These are:
- you are surrounded by smart, interesting people many of whom are new to the area and looking to make friends.
- some really awesome internally-built tools for writing code, doing code reviews, building dashboards, etc.","Disclaimer: Google is the most decentralized company I've worked for in the degree to which different groups and projects have their own work intensity, culture, ambitiousness, manager quality, etc. A lot of people I know love working here, feel they are working on interesting/important projects, and are full of respect for their colleagues and leadership. 

My experience, unfortunately, has been almost entirely negative:
- problems start with the hiring process because they put up vaguely described job openings, don't tell you almost anything about what you'll be working on during the interview, and then don't make any attempt to match you to projects you might care about or have experience with. The implied message is - you made it to Google, so you're smart enough to learn new technology, languages, and skills as needed, and we give you so much that you should be happy working on anything.
After working here for several months, my impression was:
- self-satisfaction, detachment/cluelessness/apathy and arrogance are prevalent including at the very top. 
- too many of the company's core slogans frequently don't reflect reality:
    - treating employees with respect - actually condescension disguised as benevolence 
    - caring about users - actually often dismissing them as a nuisance or too stupid to use the product correctly.
    - setting goals that are so ambitious that you fail on some - actually often failing on un-ambitious goals for non-respectable reasons
    - openness in communicating with employees - actually, most communications end up being empty hype and ass-kissing.
    - maximise efficiency and productivity - actually, even simple web front ends requires constant battle against unrelated problems with unreasonably slow or broken internal APIs, overly slow build/test/deploy tools, lack of documentation for how to use internal systems, etc.
     - fast-paced entrepreneurial culture - actually, for too many people, the main objective is to look good and score points with their manager - this is true all the way up to the VPs that report to Larry
     - hire the best people - almost everybody here is really smart, but the culture often brings out the worst most unprofessional side of people
      - taking risks and changing the world - level of risk I see people taking is changing the location of a UI button on an internal tool without talking to the product manager first","From what I saw while working on internal tools, it seems for too many managers, their highest aspiration is to keep employees occupied and to avoid looking bad in front of superiors. Other things besides this don't matter as much - not even user complaints (unless/until superiors start caring). Put another way, I was disappointed by the lack of idealism and purpose, by the excessive careerism and politics and by the us vs. them mentality between different engineering groups and between engineers and users."
