They have relied on old retail tactics of upselling insurance and credit cards and upgrade programs as much as possible. That is essentially the only thing they talk about at meetings.  When I took the job i expected a real focus on customer service, which is what they talked about in onboarding, when really the purpose of the store is to get customers to buy insurance and other monthly recurring revenue products.  Also, the reality of transferring from retail to corporate is not nearly as likely as you might think. In fact, unless you want to take a retail job in corporate, it would be wiser to work specifically in the area you want for several years then apply to Apple for it.","Advice to retail management.

A lot of managers are afraid to be truthful about the nature of the job, which is ultimately sales and technical support with a little bit of training so they dance around tough situations and sometimes aren't honest with the team.

There is a lot of politics involved with promotions. Favoritism is definitely a factor. In some cases it doesn't matter how experienced you are or how knowledgable you are, if you want to get promoted you've got to play the game.

Feedback is something that in most cases isn't used properly. Apple hires very smart people at retail division, then once they are in, the managers don't really know (or sometimes care) how to develop them.

Oh, and don't even think about giving honest feedback to leadership team. Most of them are so drunk from the Kool Aid that instead of listening to you and maybe making changes they they will dismiss your feedback or in some cases make life very difficult so you leave the company on your own.","Apple...what happened to you!

In fact, they’d rather treat new employees better and the seasoned employees, because new employees are usually still drinking the Apple Kook-aid and are still optimistic about the future. 
Don’t trust HR. Employees don’t realize that HR has a legal obligation to Apple and it’s stakeholders to protect the company and side with the company on employee issues. They are NOT looking out of the employee’s best interest. That is not their job, but they would like you to think they are. Do not confide any confidential information with.

Lack of opportunities","If you are believe in Your values, act like it.  I was in a situation where The values were ‘everyone is welcome, everyone is included, feedback and honesty is important’.  During a multi-month push on gender and gendered language inclusion training, I mentioned that I don’t feel welcome because I have a military background and I address people as ‘sir or ma’am’.  In a private conversation with the store manager, I was threatened, “learn to be more inclusive or we won’t feel comfortable giving you that promotion we have been working on.”  

I was also lied to when the store manager told me that I had failed to adapt to requests of individuals to address them in a certain way.  Distressed and not liking the feedback, I followed up with the individuals mentioned and they confirmed that I had been improving, and while it was slow at first, there weren’t any issues currently.  So, either the store manager lied, or all three of my coworkers lied.  

Either way, Apple has proven to be a typical corporate entity.  They talk one way because they are required to, but fail to live up to their policies or at least they use their own definition of commonly understood words for things like ‘inclusion’.  

Further more, advancement is only an option if you buy whole sale into extreme left wing identity politics ideology.  If any hint ever emerges that you aren’t in full, complete, and utter compliance, there will be no advancement.  You might be able to drone away in your current role for ever, but you will always be an outsider.  Ironically, ‘in groups and out groups’ was something that I was told must be avoided at all costs.

They said the woman in question needs to be over the age of 35 in order to receive any kind of compensation for NIPT. Not only was this reason ridiculous but also unfair. Age has nothing to do with it. This simply means United Healthcare does not wish to pay such a heavy sum and Apple is doing nothing to help me out in this situation.

If you like apple branded swag they definitely give you a lot of it!","Performance is based on metrics that are not necessarily reflective of your work  - they send vague email surveys to customers asking them how satisfied they were with their call experience. Of course, if they are out of warranty (majority of customers) and we cannot help them they are not going to be satisfied. One or two of these negative surveys will really impact your metrics. Escalation to Tier 2 will also impact your metrics even if it is truly beyond your control (bugs in new OS update, faulty product, etc). There is a lot of push to sell stuff to customers. Managers only care about the numbers. It is a very corporate culture that can often feel cultish. The requirement to work on Christmas/holidays is unfortunate. Very low wages in the College Program. I have heard from other employees that management could view your screens and access your camera without your knowledge, which is terrifying but I am not sure of how true it is. This position is often emotionally draining, as most people who call are upset about experiencing a technical issue, and a lot of them will take it out on you. Obviously, as an at-home position, it can be quite isolating.","Place less emphasis on metrics, which are often skewed by one or two bad CSATs that were sent by angry customers who were out of warranty or whose problems could not be resolved due to issues outside of the advisor's control. Technical training was somewhat adequate, but the position really is about providing customer care. More training for actually dealing with customers/managing expectations would be helpful but I understand the limitations in providing training for that - it is very situational.

The place is broken because of legacy culture from the top.

Whatever that means to you. To me it meant nothing.","It is a high stress job involving travel to China. Since Apple products are assembled in China, thats where most of the action happens from a Supply Chain and Operations perspective. My days started early with calls with teams in Europe. During the day i was working with teams in US. From evening until night, I was on calls with teams in China as you get a lot of requests. It was a 24x7 thankless job. If you have time to manage two projects, you'll always have four. You are not innovating or designing cool products in Supply Chain. You are only making sure these products are ready when customers want it. The only differentiator in performance is the number of hours you put in. 
1. There are not many people with great backgrounds here. Most of the folks are from supply chain backgrounds from random less reputed companies or business schools for whom having Apple on the CV is a huge uplift. Some people with good background are at senior positions who joined Apple in the early days and they are enjoying their million dollar valuation of stocks.
2. Leadership: Apple loves engineers. Most people in managerial roles got promoted from IC engineering roles and do not have an iota of aura or leadership qualities. They are very arrogant and don't care about people.
3. The work is very stressful with aggressive targets and you have to always be on top of China. I have seen people break down in meetings. Many people had health issues and were always looking to exit. Having alcohol on your table is common. There is no time for personal life. When you join you are given a paper that says 'the work you will do is so great that people dont mind spending their weekends here'. Thats a hint. LOL
4. Average employee turnover time is ten months. It is just not sustainable and that is why you can always find tons of open GSM roles on the Apple website. Apple is now a big organization and it is tough to move up and steer the politics.  
5. Culture: There is no culture. Every person is on his/her own. There is no collaboration. No one likes to share anything and people keep fighting to prove their point. You'll be doing everything yourself from scratch everytime and that will add to the hours and frustration. In my team, people fought for air time and tried to make loud conversations with team mates when manager was around. It was fake environment. The director would come to happy hour in team area for two minutes and take a mental head count of who all were present and who all were not participating in this 'team event'.  
6. Even with Apple salary, you'll just make your ends meet as this is one of the most expensive part of the world. You will never be able to afford to buy a house. You'll shell out all your money on rent and survival stuff. 
7. Career Opportunities: Depends on your relations. However every project is secretive and that limits your opportunities. Also, you can only move within your vertical. Moving to Applecare is not possible. Also, my manager dint help me in any way to find a new role when i wanted to change roles. Thats common. Also, you'll be hired because you can do the job well. Apple will not invest in your to develop new skills. You'll be doing the same work your entire life. 

In short working at Apple involves high stress, all your hours, no new skills development and little savings. The only thing you get is an Apple name on your CV. Is it worth it? You decide for yourself. International folks with MBA, this role is a trap and its tough to get out. There are better options out there.

- resume booster / career validation
- great if your satisfied with the status quo and want a paycheck to retire with

- groups within the same org can function 110% different ranging from the 9-5 group to the laid back results oriented group.
- politics and stereotypes internally abound. Was “let go” after a lengthy investigation on a violation of a policy enacted 2 years after I was hired. No psa of new zero tolerance policies, or so they said. 
- certain orgs acquire agencies and they bring that dynamic with them. Most of the time they’re siloed which is good but if you’ve been part of an agency you probably don’t want that culture in your day to day anymore
- if you want benefits (snacks, stocked fridge) , salary at the higher end of the scale and have an impact on what you’re contributing as a designer, this might not be the place for you.

You work with some of the most amazing people who are talented in a wide range of talents. You learn so much from your team members you'll always utilize them as a resource and they soon become family. The culture here is definitely unique and coming from a commissioned background, as far as sales goes, cut-throat and vindictive behaviors aren't encouraged. Moving up and growing is fairly simple, work hard, build a good rapport, and your work should be noticed. The benefits are amazing: top of the line health, dental, and vision insurance, education and fitness reimbursements (if you work near or at a campus they typically have gyms on campus for roughly $5), medical consultation form Stanford University, 3rd party corporate discounts, RSU and ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Program) and so much more! Every few months there's something called NPP (Net Promoter for out People) in which the company asks us for our feedback for things to implement change.","Working in retail is tough. The leadership team can sometimes micromanage while not assuming positive intent which is frustrating. My local leadership team tells you ""you own your own development"" but give you no direction or coaching. When first starting with the company you get a lot of training for your role, but unfortunately no training around our company's amazing benefits and how to utilize them, and when it's time to use them you're typically scrambling to get a hold of your resources.",

Allowed for some individuality - both in wardrobe expression and daily operations.,"Dealing with customers is certainly a part of retail, but we get a lot of heat from customers from decisions that corporate makes. And then, most of the time, we give the customer what they want anyways. Not to say that's wrong, but it messes with the standards and adds to the ""other Apple Store does it"" argument.
Additionally, as a part time employee hours can range from 15-30 hours per week - at least that's what the paperwork says. I was getting scheduled for about 28 hours a week consistently while also in college. This was fine until I realized that my academics were suffering, so I went to my managers and asked to reduce my hours. I was denied that because ""there aren't enough people...we need you...we have to have everyone on deck for Saturdays and Sundays"". That's certainly fair, but I didn't believe it when I saw leave requests getting approved left and right and continuous callouts throughout the whole section going unstopped.
My biggest gripe was the lack of scheduling flexibility.
I heard that there was room to grow and experiment with different jobs, but never got to experience that as I eventually ended up having to quit after a long attempt to reduce hours.
When I started not ""meeting standards"" for my position, I asked to move to a different section. I was again denied by basically being told to ""just do better"" in all aspects of my life - even after I said that this job was affecting all aspects of my life negatively and I really thought that moving out of my section would be better for everyone.",Actually try to find a solution that works for both the employee and the Store.

Unfortunately, you can't bring +1s, and they're increasingly segmenting this team away from the main events. Last party I attended, Marketing threw a holiday party for their team - and then they threw a second one that App Review was invited to. Reminds me of segregation. Not all Apple employees are created equal.

Healthcare is good - for now. Wouldn't be surprised if these full-time hourly roles eventually become contracted positions.

If you like to punch in on time - exactly on time, no more than 10-15 minutes earlier, definitely no more than 10-15 minutes later or you get written up - sit at your desk, pretend to be invisible to stay out of the drama, do your work with your head down, and then punch back out - this is exactly the right job for you.","I knew within 4 months I was going to be unhappy at WWDR. The shifts are strict. The management, with the exception of one or two, sucks. No free food. Rare team events that continue to dwindle in number over time. Lots of internal drama and power struggle. The rest of Apple looks down on you as not truly being a part of Apple. There's no visibility with anyone higher than the management level. There's very rare internal promotion. There is no feedback loop. 

Last I checked, employees were asking for a survey to provide management with feedback. The survey was conducted. Employees asked for results. Management kept dodging the question. They know something's wrong, and they don't want to acknowledge it.

Honestly. Stay away. Stay far, far away.

I stuck it out due to pressure from family and friends who insisted that having Apple on my resume would be worth the pain. Looking back, I really can't say that it was worth the years of anxiety, depression, unhappiness, that comes from a toxic environment. It got to the point where I didn't even care anymore. I was about to snap-quit any second. And I'll be honest - I was fired. Yeah, no severance pay.

I walked off campus and I felt liberated - I had absolutely no fear from being fired, which I found incredible and surprising. I took the summer off to travel and regroup. I realized I wasn't innately a depressed or anxious individual - it had developed over time from the sheer stress and unhappiness levels from this work place environment.

I heard through friends that around 15 people left the team soon after.

Within 2 weeks of deciding I was ready to come back to work, I found a new job at an awesome company with amazing culture. I wasn't going to make the same mistake twice - I was willing to take a pay cut to ensure I spent 60 hours a week in good company. (Did I mention  overtime is the norm at Apple?)

But the best part is - that wasn't necessary. I essentially doubled my salary. Based on what Glassdoor is currently reporting, I make more money than the management that fired me.

My advice: Hold out for something better if you have the opportunity. I understand sometimes options are limited, or sometimes you just really need a paycheck. But don't come to this department to stay long unless they make some big changes.",Care and do better.

-Valuable experience and development opportunities
-Managers (at my retail location) genuinely care about your personal welfare and career development (even if its outside of Apple, long term)
-Outstanding, comprehensive benefits, even available to part time employees...... if they apply to you (i.e. married parent, sick, travel a lot)
-Huge discounts on company and partner products and services
-Work life balance is taken very seriously (although salaried retail managers or corporate staff may tell a different story).
-Wholesomely aggressive commitment to company values (accessibility, environment, diversity, etc.)","-Great starting pay, but not enough for the city. Many of my single teammates who are 35-40 still need several roommates to make it by. While city market pay is higher than rural markets, it is nowhere near enough. While you do receive yearly performance based raises, they do not keep up with the high city cost of living.
-Retail and corporate are fundamentally two different companies. You don't have your ""foot in the door"". The only clear way to transition to a corporate opportunity is through highly selective ""Career Experiences"" which are literally internal temp jobs for temporary quarterly corporate needs. To just qualify, a store leader must endorse you, and you must be full time and high performing in your role. There's no internal way to really contact corporate recruiters for internships (if you're a college student) or full time opportunities. Not even your Store Leader or Market Leader knows people; you're in a walled garden.
-Human Resources is very self-congratulatory and cult-like. Executive level HR staff hold town halls to field questions every year or so (90% of which pertain to lack of comparable compensation) just to offset everyone's living concerns with ""it's a privilege to work here.""
-Bonuses come in the form of 3 year period RSUs; you have to stay with the company for three years for the RSU to vest and thus cash out. Only management and up receive comparable cash bonuses. Every year after measily raises come out, you may get a lousy $100 cash bonus to make you feel better. Some high performance quarters you may also receive a $100 bonus. Don't spend it all in one place.
-Because of this, many tenured staff leave to other high paying tech companies in Boston (FormLabs, HubSpot, Chewy, Wayfair) to continue their career because they get capped at roughly $45k without staying 5-10 more years or going into management. That looks good on paper but is the bare bone minimum in Boston.","End the internal divide, yes we're a great company but we're no longer the only cool kid on the block.

Depending on your specific location, starting and entry level roles will earn between $18-$19 per hour. Each role above entry level pays you 10-20% more based on performance and tenure. If you are full-time, expect to be earning between $21-$25 an hour within just a couple of years.
- Annual pay raises (Apple calls them ""merit increases"" are typically generous, but are determined based on the stores overall performance metrics. Expect a minimum annual raise of 2-5%. 
- Restricted Stock Units (RSU's) are available and are gifted to ALL employees, part-time, full-time, entry level and beyond. These are free stock gifts that vest over a three year period. Expect somewhere around $2000 and up per year, this is an AWESOME benefit.
- Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP) offers you a 15% discount off of Apple stock which you use to purchase shares twice per calendar year. This is another AWESOME benefit. In my time at Apple, I saw this benefit alone make colleagues millionaires. I mean that. If you invest right and are with the company for the longterm, Apple's ESPP can make you a millionaire. 
- Overall benefits package is truly exceptional. This is the number one reason to work for Apple and/or Apple Retail. Health benefits are exceptional and affordable. Dental and vision are much the same. A ton of benefits exist for continuing your education, growing your financial portfolio, health and wellness and more. Taking full advantage of the benefits package will only help reward you further for your work done at Apple.
- Discounts on Apple products is exceptional. At least 25% off of everything (often times much more) for your personal purchases, at least 15% off of everything for friends and family. Additional ""third party"" discounts on accessory products, camera equipment, cellular service, rental car services, concierge services, auto loans, and so much more are also available. 
- 401k match is decent, up to 6% dollar for dollar once you have been with the company five years.
- Paid time off for full-time employees is decent with added ""bonus"" days added each year. Paid time off increases at the five year, ten year and fifteen year mark with the company. 
- Every employee receives sick time. Yes, part-time employees too.","- If you get hired at Apple, come in thirsty. Real thirsty. You're going to be drinking a TON of Kool-Aid. Throughout your on boarding and training experience you will be forced to drink Kool-Aid, swallow it and gulp down some more. You will be expected to sing the companies praises at every turn. This will not change, either be ready for it or you will not last.
- Management varies greatly by location, but is in general, a sad, poor excuse for a ""leader"" (they give themselves this title, it is not earned). You will, without question come across the occasional member of management of ""gets it,"" these men and women will make a profound impact on you. Sadly, they are far and few between and the rest of the junk will win out.
- Nearly everyone is hired in at the entry level roles (Specialist or Technical Specialist) and nearly everyone promotes quickly (usually once per year for the first two or three years). Once you have two or three promotions under your belt, typically just beneath the management level, your development with COMPLETELY STALL. The ""elevated"" positions (in order: Pro, Lead, Lead Genius, Manager, Senior Manager, Store ""Leader"") are limited and competition for them is stiff. If you land one of these ""elevated"" roles, get comfortable. You will be in it for a WHILE. YEARS.
- Store ""Leaders"" are NEVER in the building. Senior Managers typically run the day-to-day store operations.
- Turnover is incredibly, ridiculously, annoying high. If you get hired, please expect roughly 35-40% of your location to completely turn over per year. You will see a huge hiring increase around the fall and holiday period, hiring will stop around the New Year, people will drop like flies until the next fall, process starts over again.
- Work/life balance is a joke. Do not expect to have it. Do not expect to get any holiday's off, do not expect scheduling to do you any favors. Time off requests have to be made 4-5 weeks in advance and if you want any chance of actually getting the time approved, request it 8-10 weeks in advance. As a result of new product launches, do not even think of asking for ANY time off in September, October or November, EVER. 
- Development is a joke.
- Internal politics are EVERYTHING at Apple. You MUST ""play the game."" 
- Time and attendance policy is a JOKE. There is no penalty for being late, calling off, missing work. Other team members will take advantage of this and will leave you stranded.
- A ton of ""rules"" are in place with management that will greatly impact you. A person can only be in a role for so long (they want you to move, up and laterally, often). Expect to be in any one role for just about a year until you are pushed into something else. Please note, often times these are NOT promotions but lateral moves to ""add tools to your tool belt."" Apple's ""culture of feedback"" is a genius and evil way of ALWAYS having a justified way to pushback against your plans, development, hopes and more. EVERYTHING at Apple can be looped back to feedback, be prepared to ask management for something and for them to respond with feedback on how you need to improve first. This is a cycle, it happens over and over again.
- If you push back against the ""Apple way,"" be prepared to be forced out. ALWAYS ask for and accept feedback. Always speak highly of Apple products. Always support and get behind new services and initiatives. Always defend the customer, never your colleague. Always smile and nod. Never show frustrations, disappointment or anger. Apple wants smile robots - be one and you will go far.","- Do not let the polices dictate the service. Common sense exceptions to policy and procedure MUST be made to make for a great employee and customer service experience. Empower your team to make these exceptions and support them when they do.
- Learn how to provide and accept Fearless Feedback as is it trained. ALL feedback is constructive feedback, whether it positive or negative. Feedback is not a blanket to stunt development, rather, a tool to encourage it. 
- Do not put barriers in the way of tenured employees. 
- Learn the business and your role at a deeper level than you do. Management needs to know and understand ALL roles in the store well enough to perform them if needed.
- Support your team. Believe them. Take them at their word.
- STOP thinking you have authority or that you are at all accomplished. You are not."

I have some of the greatest friends on my team and the thought of leaving that behind makes me sad. Great health/dental benefits and tuition reimbursement. It sucks because I go to a private art school and Apple doesn’t recognize this as education so I can’t be reimbursed for tuition which is a joke. I’m spending just as much if not more money than public education students at a university.,"Work-life balance is SO off balance. Apple claims to promote a healthy work-life balance and they don’t show anything for it. I hate the way requesting time off works because if other employees requested time off months in advance for the same day you try to get off the month you’re wanting it off, you’re screwed because the threshold of people who requested that day off is met. Every. Time. This makes you look bad as an employee because it forces you to call out just so you can get away from the work environment and give yourself a vacation you deserve. The work gets monotonous. Apple claims that they believe in giving feedback to better the work place but when you give it no behavior is ever changed. The managers aren’t terribly helpful and you are micromanaged. Apple is the first US company to make it to 1 trillion dollars and you sure don’t feel it as an employee. They don’t give you free access to Apple Music as an employee, they give you nothing but a water bottle for Christmas and make you attend meetings quarterly on Sundays which are a day of worship for many employees. The ability to move in the company is impossible and if you do want to move up in the company you have to butt kiss your managers because it’s all just a big popularity contest in terms of getting promoted to a better higher paying position. If these things changed then this would be an amazing place to work.",Stop preaching that you respect work-life balance when you do nothing for us to promote that. I have to pull teeth to get a vacation when others take multiple vacations a year. Hire managers hat are more understanding and change your attendance policy to the way it was. We allow customers to freely browse our stores and even trust them enough to check out their own products if they choose to do so. Show your employees the same amount of trust by bringing back the old way attendance was.

If you are an apple customer and you're reading this, please, please leave a survey for the individual employee  only based on their skill/performance by their means to try and help you.

It seems only corporate employees are compensated for the type of work they do even though the retail workers are what driving the companies profits in general .

Retail is the true heart of producing profits for Apple but employees are treated as expendable.  There’s a lot of phenomenal talent at the retail level but you are often treated just as another blue shirt and number.   Retail management has become lazy and robotic like.   The San Francisco Bay Area is the most expensive place to live and the company is based in there so they can’t be unaware that the cost of living has skyrocketed and salary is unbalanced and not enough for workers at the base positions at retail level ."

Apple has grown old and both leadership and management want only to be worshiped; they only want to listen to praise.

The amount of kool-aid that Apple employees are forced to drink on a daily basis only compares to the best (or worst) years of Facebook or Yahoo. And again, don't be a dissenting voice or your life will be made hell.

[...]
From Apple's campaign ""Think Different"".

It's difficult to be ""a misfit"" or ""a rebel"" when the overwhelming majority of Apple executives, directors, managers are millionaires (or billionaires). Apple management **is** the status quo.

Extremely hard to move up (there are a LOT of employees at each location, plus there are internal candidates looking for transfers to compete with). 

Always hiring. Also a con, because management is stretched so thin, that adding new people to the staff often takes precedence over the development of current employees. 

With so many people on staff, it can be next to impossible to efficiently convey information when changes happen. Things change quickly (and often), but information disseminates slowly. 

Some of the upper management (senior managers, etc.) come from management positions that don’t require them to interact with the sales floor frequently (if ever), so they can be a little “by the book” or “bottom line” in their management style.

If you are offered the iOS App Reviewer position or any other position in this department, deny it & look somewhere else. 

Now let’s get into the details...

The only pros are:

- Classy Apple badge
- 401K match & health insurance 
- Employee discounts 

*These are the perks for now, but will likely change in the future","- Apple culture does not exist here, but instead a toxic culture does! If you are expecting to work for Apple and experience real Apple culture, this place is not for you. The sole purpose of this job is to clock in, sit at your desk for 10 hours, and be a darn robot by simply just approving/rejecting apps all day, every day. Additionally, it is a very toxic/soulless culture since there is an incredible amount of negativity created among employees due to the way management treats its employees. It is to the point where people are even scared to talk to each other during the day since management has created a culture of fear...

- Career suicide. Whether this is an early job in your career or a job taken on later in your career, it is career suicide. There are zero transferrable skills you will gain from this job. Your best bet out of this organization is to go gain new skill sets on your own. 

- Management’s idea to ensure employees are productive is to micro management them like no other. Your clock in/clock out times, breaks, computer activity, and the amount of time you spend in the bathroom are monitored down to the minute. If management feels you are in violation of any of these categories, be prepared to get talked to/monitored consistently even if you are an employee that gets work done on a daily basis. 

You as an employee must salute management at all times. Unreal. This style of management is a very childish way to manage adults and such micro management tactics breaks an organization, creates a toxic culture, & makes employees rebel against each other. Due to this, you have a team where 200+ people are looking for jobs all at once, which is not something you see often...

- Lack of real managerial experience, arrogance, & competence among management is a huge problem. Employees on this team have some basic ideas to solve the organization’s problems, but the lack of real management experience, arrogance, & competence at a management level makes it impossible for changes to occur. If you have any ideas, they are simply not welcomed and will be shot down by management instantly. Essentially, you as an employee must accept management’s stupid ideas or go take a walk.

- Employee appreciation? Pffftt. What’s that? In this org, you are treated worse than animals. It is all about work! work! work! As mentioned earlier, you are a robot tied to your desk for 60/hours a week with zero flexibility in work hours. Also, expect to work six days a week all the time, work 12 hour days often, & be *forced* to work every national US holiday. Additionally, management simply does not believe in retaining its employees, giving their employees rest, & thanking employees for their hard work. Management has even taken away company events from its employees. Instead, the philosophy is to throw more work at them until they burnout & quit.

- Taking a vacation & falling sick in this department are considered to be a crime. If you as an individual wish to take a vacation, good luck ever getting the time approved. Everyone’s vacation time is closely monitored and it is up to the department’s discretion to decide if you are allowed to go on a vacation during the dates of your choosing. 

Also, during fall employees are told there is a strict “vacation blackout” period, which means you cannot take a vacation during September - December due to “business needs”. Such a restriction ensures employees can never enjoy a Thanksgiving or Christmas with their loved ones, which is cruel and inhumane. In addition, if you ever fall sick and can’t make it to work, expect your manager to guilt trip you for being sick the day you come back.

- Career growth? Ha, good luck. Expect zero guidance from anyone in  management on how to grow your career within the company. During your time in this department, you are expected to be an approve/reject robot & nothing else. In fact, many other departments at Apple have figured out the ugly truths of App Review, which make it almost impossible to transfer internally. If you do join this department, your best bet is to look at another company for a job.

- Nepotism like no other. In this department, the ones that get elevated are the ones that simply suck up to management & become close friends with them. If you are a hard worker on this team, you’ll simply be told to do more until the life is sucked out of you. Competence is not a required skill set to get elevated in this org.","Well, ideally the whole place needs a reboot, but for now management needs to stop being so oblivious/soulless and needs to start to give a damn about what’s going on. It really isn’t that difficult to solve the problems - back off on the micro management, give employees an equal chance to grow their careers within the company, & most importantly treat your employees with some dignity/respect. Perhaps somebody should teach management that it is important to treat your employees like how you would wish to be treated, sheesh! 

Additionally, it would be a great idea for the company’s HR department and executive management to truly investigate what has been going on in this department for a while & identify resolutions from an executive management level. What is so mind boggling is that executive management has allowed the problems in this org to continue on for so long. 

Ironically, since no changes are being made to fix this toxic culture, the effects have started to show. Employees that once used to care about this place are leaving at a rapid pace, new hires are leaving within weeks of joining, and existing employees simply don’t care anymore. It is only a matter of time until this department breaks apart into pieces...

Now after reading all of this, if you still decide to take the job, god bless you & may the force be with you to survive the hurricane you are about to be a part of."

Benefits are not anything special until you've been an employee for 5 years and then you get a good 401k match and PTO. Starting pay is competitive, but even with great performance review, raises are very small.","The things customers say when they don't get their way and then how frequently management caves and gives into their ridiculous requests, managers are often inexperienced, workload is ever increasing yet the pay does not match responsibilities or even compete with other companies that generate this level of revenue. Often do not have enough work supplies because ""they're expensive"" and offsite Genius training was canceled (is Apple going broke??) and so you're forced to learn from the very limited stock of Geniuses at your store who are often mistaken and undertrained. The break rooms in every store I've ever been into are basic and often too small for the number of employees. Too many part time employees. Tons of people call out because they're hungover or just don't feel like coming in and the penalties are minimal, if any. Speaking of, that is another con- most employees are almost constantly micromanaged and undervalued.","Hire retail managers with experience motivating and leading large teams, increase pay or at least provide opportunities for performance-based bonuses, stop with the RSU stocks, they are basically worthless because of the tax implications. LISTEN to NPP results because your employees are leaving because they feel like you don't care about them anymore. Stop pretending like you care about customers and just admit the real reason behind all of these cutbacks are to increase profits and executive salaries."

This department is in shambles. The mixture of horrible management and a toxic environment that becomes worse and worse with every passing day is not sustainable. 
People reading these reviews might be confused as to why some are positive and some so negative. I will clarify that for you - look at the dates! Once upon a time working here was amazing. The previous director knew you by name and the team was very tight and close. We all worked hard but were also rewarded. More than anything there was a true sense of teamwork and community. You could rely on one another. Everyone was there to help each other no matter what their role in the department was. This is one of the most diverse departments in all of Apple and that used to be celebrated. People were happy and proud to work on that team and for each other. The older positive reviews are for the golden age of App Review. Unfortunately, those days are long long gone. 
So what happened? Management changes. And it’s been a free fall ever since. The new director put in is never there and just doesn’t care about his employees. His only concern since being put in this role has been the implementation of new tools that he created without ever having any kind of understanding or insight on how the reviewers do their jobs.
They started hiring people from AppleCare - arguably the worst department of Apple corporate. First it was the current operations manager who just has been hiring his cronies ever since. Instead of hiring from within with more than qualified candidates who also have a deep understanding and knowledge of the job function and where to improve he brings up his friends from AppleCare of his golf buddy. The managers that were with the department before have become spineless as their complaints fall on deaf ears too. Most just come in to work everyday to collect their paychecks and wait for their stocks to vest. The others have become so stressed out and take it out on reviewers by micromanaging every aspect of their time at work from what time you punch in to how long you take in the bathroom to checking your screens to see what you’re doing. Their unhappiness and helplessness trickles down to the already unhappy reviewers. 
Instead of being a united team this department is now filled with interoffice politics and drama. We no longer have fun events. we no longer have lunch provided. We work longer hours and significantly less flexible shifts. Reviewers are in fear of talking to each other and everyone is on edge. Other departments at Apple have figured this out and will not hire you from App Review. They dont want to touch us with a 10 foot pole. And so unless you decide to start sucking up with the head of operations you have no future in Apple in this department or otherwise. And trust me you do not want to be at a dead end job with this high of a work toxicity level. And if you still decide to take this job you cant say you weren’t warned.",Well this advice would not be for the management of App Review because they are without any hope - but to the executive level management my advice is to get in there and do something because this place is a ticking time bomb.

- Every once and awhile you help a customer with a heart warming story and it makes your day
- Higher than average pay for retail but at a cost (see cons)","The Dangling Carrot
- The work to pay balance isn't right. You're expected to help multiple customers at once, talk about ALL Apple Services and Store Programs with every customer, help them quicker  and quicker and constantly be in a high stress environment that makes the higher than average pay mean next to nothing when you realize you're doing the work of 2 to 3 employees
- Apple is one of the largest companies in the world and staffs it's stores like it may be going out of business any day now. Customers regularly wait 20-30+ minutes just to get the opportunity to talk to someone to buy something. This can even happen if the person knows exactly what they want, has no questions, and is ready to pay. That stress is directly put on you as leadership hides behind an iPad or in an office but tells you to work faster from afar. 
- Apple's goal is to positively impact humanity but they seem to forget their own employees are part of that humanity. Your career ambitions are ignored, favoritism is rampant, they put more and more pressure on their people while giving them less and less resources to deal with it.
- Their promotion practice is hidden and vague so that they can always make up excuses about why you aren't ready to get promoted. There are no clear metrics or avenues for job growth just management preference and their favorites are forced to the front of the queue while much more capable and deserving team members are passed over. When you're told you're not able to interview for a new position or promotion they make up reasons like ""what books are your currently reading about self development?"" or other vague open ended questions that have no right answer because whatever you say they will tell you its not good enough.
-It is a regular practice that they will handpick people for promotions, interview them, and give them the job before they even let the team know the job is available. The day the job is posted is the same day they tell the staff someone already got the position. It's ok that they choose who they think is ready for promotion but the hidden nature of the process makes it look like under the table deals and favoritism is the only way to get ahead.
- Apple has the clout to hire managers etc from outside of the company in a job role far below their last job. This means department store general managers and district managers are regularly hired as entry level managers at Apple (2 to 3 steps below their past position at their prior job). This makes an impossible void for anyone internally to get promoted to management. You're essentially shown that you need to be able to run 8-12 stores on your own before you can be moved up to be a basic manager at Apple. They give no opportunity for people to exhibit these skills internally so there will always be a very large divide between what they expect and what they allow internal candidates to show the competency for. This means that you're far more likely to move up at Apple by leaving the company, getting promoted elsewhere, and then coming back several years later to take a step down in role when you return.
- Managers do very little to support the sales floor and technicians throughout the day. They blindly stand around and wait for issues to escalate before they step in.... in the meantime they are online buying sneakers, sitting in a closed door office drinking coffee, or having meetings that have no purpose while the rest of the staff handles the pressure of the day.","- Stop it with the favoritism and the talk of ""Our people are our greatest resource"" when you clearly are still in high school picking your friends to be on your gym class kickball team. 
- Give high performing, hard working, senior team members the chance to move up rather than the kid that knows how to say the right thing in an interview but has no skill to back it up. 
- Hire more people! The customers demand it and your staff is overworked. The need is there in every store, the genius bar is always packed, sales staff is never enough, and even management claims there aren't enough of them to go around when they are needed. You claim to have the goal of ""impacting humanity"" but you don't give your stores or your staff the time or the resources to actually try and do that. Just hurry up and sell or fix and move onto the next one faster and faster. 
- Be more transparent with reasons why decisions are made on a design or policy level. Why was the audio jack removed, why is their only USB-C on your new Macs, why do I need to send my device out to depot for 3-5 days for repair,  why does the website make it so hard to schedule in store repairs? These are everyday questions asked by customers and your team has to make up excuses to try to make sense of it all. Train your teams to answer hard questions like this with definitive company sanctioned answers rather then just forcing it on customers and letting sales and service team members try to make up excuses for angry customers. 
- Promote more internally. These managers you continue to hire from outside the company do not understand the values or culture of the company nor do they understand the jobs and interactions team members are forced to do every day. This disconnect causes most managers to see team members as ""tools"" rather then people because they don't understand what they have to do everyday, they just understand their purpose (Fix or sell).

So much more to say but this about sums up my experience. Apple survives off of it's appeal and unending revenue streams but it's stores are facing a tipping point. If you continue to force customers to wait up to a half hour for sales help, and service customers to wait for days for appointments you will continue to disappoint your base and drive away your once loyal fans. You think Today at Apple is the future of our stores? How about that important world class customer service that used to be a thing? Having a class that teaches people about taking a photo on their phone isn't going to be what makes people return to your stores (people have lives and busy schedules). No, quick, efficient, and high level service is.  You once trained the staff to offer high level ""Ritz Carlton"" service... but now you settle for fast food burger joint service as long as they quickly move onto the next customer."

I still can't believe I get paid to talk about Apple products/services, problem solve with customers, teach them how to use their products, and engage in the evolving ecosystem. They treat us extremely well in comparison to a lot of other industries. 

When you've got the right leadership team, they know how to really step back and let you do your job. Sometimes it means a slacker will abuse it, but for the most part in a store off 200+ everyone is able to do their job and keep that customer focus. 

You can grow and achieve whatever you apply yourself towards. You're working with the best of the best and it can be tougher to grow in this company than in others, but its possible. It may mean moving stores or even going to corporate. However, if you're worth your salt and plot a path, you can go anywhere internally or leverage that to go externally to another company. 

I don't know what else to add that other reviews haven't also already mentioned. Bottom line, I'd recommend working here in a heartbeat, and even when my time working here comes to an end, it won't be because it was a bad job or company to work for.","The employee experience in the retail stores isn't what it used to be. I don't mean this in a grumpy old man, ""back in my day"" kind of reflection. It really has taken a shift towards a sales focused leadership guidance - which anyone who worked there prior to 2014 will say managers used to never mention sales numbers to the team. It was always about customer experience and the numbers from customer surveys. 

I'm not sure Angelas vision of 'town centers' is a possibility in the majority of stores. I love the idea at the flagship locations but the mall stores aren't ever going to be someones 'third place'. 

It's been a bummer watching them slow down the amount of in-store repairs. The genius' are slowly dying inside as they ship more and more things out of store for repairs. Also, they stopped sending the new genius' out for training and while it may no be necessary it was certainly a big event in many folks career here. To see Apple invest so much into you really created some loyalty and made you less likely to leave. Not so much any more.   

Yes, it's a retail environment, even though it's not a 'traditional retail' feel. So the hours can be hard on a work/life balance, but the vacation days and ability to request time off allows a certain flexibility (unless its between Black Friday and mid January and it's all hands on deck).",

* Good benefits.","Not only is is not the company I thought I joined - it's no longer even the company I joined (if that makes sense). Things have really been going downhill as growth has increased without sufficient pruning and evaluation. 

The results of that are

* The company is full of processes that work great for a very high average quality engineering population of 1,000 or less, but are terrible for a medium average quality engineering population of 10,000 or more. As a result management is re-inventing the terrible practices of the past, such as: 
  - Making project too big to fail rather than small enough to succeed
  - Adding people rather than competences
  - Treating everybody as interchangeable parts rather than individuals with strengths and weaknesses
  - Restraining employee mobility and growth, presumably to retain head count and talent for local reasons, which hurts the company on a grander scale

* Bad to terrible management on all levels that I encountered. Internal mobility is often curtailed and actively opposed, even though that should be one of the big benefits of working in a big company that does products on the whole stack. 

* HR is definitely not on your side. 

* Too many people seem to think that success is assured, and revert to pointless, zero-sum infighting instead of working hard to keep the products successful by delivering value and delight to the customers.

* 1,000s of uncoordinated, small geeky features added rather than 10s of simple, useful and customer-aligned features.

* Products getting long in the tooth with no new hit in sight. 

* Too many products compromized by tying them to each other without consideration for whether it benefits the customer. 

* Base pay levels below average. Bonus is too high a % of your comp.

In conclusion: Time to trim the fat in products, management and peers.","Do a proper review of your lower 2-3 tiers of management for actual performance. Many of them curb initiative, personal/professional growth and internal mobility. This really hurts morale over time. At the time I left, it seemed that nobody working in the engineering layer were happy with their current tasks and future prospects. Management knew for almost two years that these were the biggest pain points in the org., and somehow never got around to taking actual steps that would improve this.

Stop tying products to each other without a clear benefit to the user. In particular: Rethink Siri Assistant - it may be the future, but here and now it's just not working as well for regular people as it should."

Its organizational structure, culture, and processes are more conservative than most of its peers. This sounds like a bad thing on its face if you're looking for the ""true Silicon Valley experience"" but I find that experience is overrated anyway.

Apple doesn't strive to make everyone friends and to foster a Google-y culture of self- expression at the office. But I find that's really nice. Don't want to have to deal with losers and idiots who you can't stand? Think if you met James Damore in person you'd want to punch him in the face (or, conversely, whatever the conservative analog is)? You will, but you probably won't know it because those people don't feel the need to express themselves personally at work. Find some people you like? Cool--you can hang out on break or after work. It's like the U Chicago of schools: some people will think it's ""where the fun goes to die""; others (like me) think it's where you go to do really valuable, interesting work and hopefully make some friends along the way.

Apple is kind of like a really really really hard video game. It takes a long long time to learn the ropes, figure out what's going on, and unlock most of the cool and interesting equipment to play with. But that makes it all the more rewarding when you do git gud and figure it out.

No one gives a hoot who you are, what your identity is, what you think should happen, etc. until you've proven yourself. It's a double-edged sword: it's a turnoff in the short term, but if you work hard and care about the product then you feel that much more empowered when you do get people to care.

Also it's a company that's in the midst of really interesting growth. If you want to have a chance to shape how products used by literally billions of people evolve, then come to Apple.

If you care about ethics and consumer privacy, Apple is also an amazing place to work: when you're on the inside you have an even greater appreciation of how hard the company works to preserve those values.","Apple's culture definitely isn't for everyone. All knowledge is silo-ed and tribal. There's no documentation. The internal tools are clunky and counter-intuitive. Sometimes the tech stack is creaky with age (though it's slowly but surely evolving).

It's not a particularly friendly or inviting place, even now after Steve's been gone for years.

Some parts of Apple are also absolutely riven with internal politics and dysfunction. This is slowly changing for the better, but for the time being I'd avoid taking positions at Ad Platforms or IS&T unless you're confident it'll be a good resume boost (in case you need to bounce in a year or two, which you just might).

Apple is also a very demanding place to work for many teams. If you're working on a team that's *really* getting things done, don't be surprised if you work as hard as or harder than you've ever done in your life. That work is really valuable and rewarding, but don't come to Apple and expect as much or more leisure time as your last job unless you're coming from i-banking or something.","Don't get stuck thinking this is still 1999 and the company needs a ""pirate culture"" to survive. We're way too big for that now and the worst offenders feel like they are preserving some kind of golden age culture. We're the biggest company in the world and we just need focus on what generates the most innovation (even when it flies in the face of what worked in the past) and dreaming big, not the culture that got the company through the late 90s.

On the other hand, don't let Apple become the next Oracle. We have way too much talent to sit on our laurels and try to acquire our way to continued relevance. We are some of the most talented but realistic folks on the planet. Keep innovating within the bounds of reason."

I know HR is supposed to protect the company, but you have horrible untalented people driving out talent and rotting you from bottom up. Making sure that such people don't infest the company should be a priority for HR if they want to protect the company. 
- HR is an admin call center. 
This may be fine for a small company but this is a company of a 100k people. My advice to anyone considering an offer with them is: make sure you like your manager and document everything from the beginning. 
If you get along with your manager, this is a great company to work with.
 But know that there is 0 accountability for bad managers and so there are toxic teams that go undetected. HR is useless and they will have all the power if you make them insecure or if they suddenly decide they don't want to work with you. 
Also like other notorious hardware companies, some teams here try to put people on PIP to get them to quit (quitting could be for whatever reasons, including mis-management and then realizing they over-hired). I have now heard more than a few stories along these lines. Since there is no manager accountability, they can get away with anything.",protect yourself from terrible low level managers. Build out HR into something more than an admin function. Talent leaves not because of bad company but bad managers. Making them at least a little bit accountable will prevent them from rotting you on the inside.

Coworkers are amazingly talented and super friendly, so work is never boring! It's a very engaging environment and you do feel like you are part of the company instead of just a 'subordinate' to management and corporate. You aren't bound to act a certain way or speak a certain way to customers; management encourages you to be yourself and make a connection with the customer on a deeper level before selling products. In the end, you get to meet some very interesting customers and make valuable connections with them.  
In addition to all of that, Apple provides great benefits, including insurance, reimbursements, and employee discounts. Hourly pay for retail employees is also very good. 
Overall, working for Apple was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I will cherish my experience there for years to come.","Very minimal work/life balance. Considering I was a student at the time, it was hard to work a nine hour shift on a weekend and still stay caught up with school work and make time to be social (just an example). I was part-time and I pretty much worked every single day I indicated availability for. Many full-time employees don't notice it, but for part-timers, it can be hard to balance a few different things when one weights so much more. Also, being that it is a retail store, you will also have to deal with irate/difficult customers on different occasions, especially if you break some bad news to them about their device. But, customer interaction aside, I feel that the minimal work/life balance hindered me from being a well-rounded student/friend/employee, and eventually caused my final decision to depart the company and pursue other routes.","Please address the work/life balance concern. I know of many other employees that feel the same way and would love to see a change come directly from corporate. Leaving Apple was one of the toughest decisions I've made since I loved the job so much. It was a great stepping stone for me as I transitioned from college to professional life. Yet, I feel that I was dedicating almost all my free time to the store. Despite how much I enjoyed working each shift, I felt that my overall productivity level outside of the store was dropping since I had no time to dedicate anywhere else. Possibly hiring more people per store and easing up on hours so there's more of an equal distribution of hours would be incredibly helpful."

It's clear to me that if you are a high contributor in your group and take advantage of the Apple benefits, you will be compensated accordingly and feel like you are valued.  This will require a work-life imbalance, so be willing to sacrifice weekends or evenings if you want to be a high contributor and receive larger raises, cash bonus and RSUs.  Otherwise, raises, cash bonus and RSUs will be smaller or non-existent.  You can't ""coast along"" here or become stagnant.  If you do, compensation will suffer.  I had the time of my life working at Apple, and if not for a 2 hour (each way) commute to work each day, I would absolutely still be working there.","In order to live in Silicon Valley where you can raise a family, it is extremely expensive.  I had to live a 2-hour commute (each way) away from Sunnyvale in order to own a good house in a good school district.  As a high contributor in my group, I made a substantial amount of money, but it was not enough to live close to work.  Living in Silicon Valley is not a problem unique to Apple, but that's the biggest pain point that I had.

The larger the store is the less it feels like a family. Employees in the genius bar are meant to focus on building a relationship with the customer but also keep the appointment sessions to about 10-15 minutes on average while also talking about: Today at Apple sessions, our business team, we are encouraged to slow down but at the same time are pushed to speed up all while trying to probe the customer so that we can figure out how to solve the issue brought in today. Managers bend to many customers who act childish and demand that they get their way but for a father who brings in their child's iPad that just won't power on anymore and they're less than a week past warranty they say, ""Well, it's out of warranty so they have to pay."" Seriously? Then that makes the employee look like the jerk because they have to relay the bad news.  Their employee rating tool is very flawed. Customers receive surveys asking how they're experience was. One rating the actual person they worked with and the other side of the survey pertains to their overall store experience outside of working with their technician. Even if they like who they worked with but didn't like the wait time or something else, then they will give a lower rating out of 5 stars and anything below 5 is a negative on the employee. Co-workers didn't go the extra mile for the customers (activations on replacement phones, making sure things transfer completely etc.) and I found myself having to clean up after their missteps. The company rolled out software that slowed down peoples phone once they're battery degraded passed a certain use and told no one, not even the employees. so for so long we would say "" oh it must be the software, let's restore your phone."" and this entire time we were giving them wrong information and we did even know it. Now there are quality programs for free or highly discounted repairs. Customers treat us like a doormat and although we were paid well; we weren't paid well enough for the things that we had to go through by being the ""face of the company.""

Working at Apple really dresses up your resume.
Expectations are very high for everyone. Consultants included.
There was a high end Latte / Espresso machine in the break area.
Private office which had no windows and was quiet.
Interesting  people to meet in the hall once and a while.
Everyone is painfully hip. The more face and body art - the more
Apple""y"" end edgy it seems to be.
People seem to watch the edgy commercials on TV and dress the part at work.

The commute bus. Huge huge perk.
Employees get a good EDD discount on new Apple products.

Working with people who code at the speed of light.

Some of the buildings and offices are private. This is a HUGE perk.

If you have a creative job at Apple and you are not keeping infrastructure running
then I think you will be very happy.

You will work with the brightest people in the world.
You may gain tattoos and face art in the process because everyone else will be wearing it.

Apple is mostly a young culture- 25 to 35 is the mean age.

My team did NOT have SCRUM. I hate SCRUM / Jira
And escaping the SCRUM disease even for 5 months was a HUGE bonus.

The Large Apple Park RING is filling up. I hear it is pretty cool in there.
But mostly Facebook style seating.
Gee, thanks Facebook (not!)","There is no life balance in some teams. 
The team I was in - everyone worked nights from home and weekends from home.
In Monday staff meeting all you listened to was what problem people solved on
their free time over the weekend.
If you want to live to work by all means.

Apple has high internal security.
Some employees are cleared with a RED badge and live behind walled areas
which other employees and consultants can't access.

You can't talk to other employees about what you are working on. Period.

You need to do exactly as you are told with no questions.

When something needs done - it needs to be executed precisely and on the day as requested. Or your job as a consultant could be in jeopardy.

Internal politics were as there is only one right way to do something and yet
your boss and his boss ""The Director"" have differing needs - can land you in
trouble as you need to decide to please one or the other.
I chose the Director. Mistake.

You will probably be required to work at home on weekends and at night.
This is not something I want to do week after week and month after month.

Know that you will be pushed to your limits and expected to assimilate any instructions instantly. 

Hint - use your iphone to take pictures (notes) of difficult instructions.

Apple is what it is.

If you are in the IT section of Apple you will have to follow orders exactly.
I have never worked in a creative job at Apple. Probably would be wonderful.","Try to actually feel with your heart and not be so hard core hard rock that you just throw people out the door when you are displeased at a minor artifact.

Pay consultants over the holidays and just don't send them home for an unpaid vacation.

Plan you next HIT product which will keep Apple going.
There are only so many iPhone improvements now which will matter to the market at large.

Bring back the magsafe connector on the new Macbook pro's. The USB-C sucks for power."

Maybe if you work with with their core business in hardware this may still be the company you think it is.

If you are anywhere in the administrative side all I can tell you is run away! They hire very incompetent upper management who create a horrible work culture. It takes you at least 30 days to schedule an appointment  with a psychiatrist in Austin and if you ask them why it's because they are full of the Apple employees who are trying not to lose their minds! Even the doctors on campus will admit that they can't believe the amount of employees who suffer chronic stress issues because of the work culture. 

My advice is simple, if you have ambition and seek to grow in a successful career, run as far as you can from Apple. If you are a more relaxed person who only cares about getting a paycheck maybe you should consider it. 

This is the type of place that makes you regret getting a promotion. Every time you go up the latter you are exposed to more and more incompetence until you want to throw your iMac out the window! 

There is no respect for employees, no effort in providing what is needed for the job they ask you to do. Everyone is expected to deal with enormous amounts of ambiguity simply because they don't want to spend the money on clarifying anything. The internal tools are by far the worst I have had to use. Your hair will fall as the system crashes constantly and management refuses to spend the money on decent software. While I was an hourly employee we had to use a software to punch in and out except the tool would always break when you were trying to leave. It still baffles me how a company with as much money as Apple treats their employees as second class citizens compared to their customers.  

I regret spending just under 4 years of my career in this madhouse. Bragging rights are not worth it! Keep your barista job along with your sanity.

They also discriminate with Texas employees and offer a crappy version of the healthcare they offer in California. California employees get a much better deal with Kaiser. Texas get crappy healthcare that will leave you owing hundreds every time you actually need to use it.",Put in your two weeks notice and go be happy with your life.

- Wait times for appointments being HOURS for same-day service and at least a week for book-from-home.

- belittling constantly
- angry customers cursing
- getting called names solely because you were the shirt and work for the company

- They start you higher than the average retailer but for what you have to deal with and for how much the company makes daily, weekly, annually.. its actually a joke. 
- After taxes and benefits get taken out, only average $10-12 an hour. Constantly having sales and business goals to meet but no commission or incentives based on fantastic performance. Average sales were over $100,000 a month and you see absolutely nothing.

-Managers will hear you out, they do not ignore complaints, but ultimately there is little they can do. 
-Discounts on products, including a significant one you get to use every 3 years.","I am going to start with how it feels to work here. First I should say, I LIKE Apple products and own one or two. That being said, the culture at Apple feels like a professional cult. There is a definite feeling of being watched... all of the time, and then being ""corrected"" whenever you think the wrong way. 
Examples:

-Chats being monitored - any negative statements are immediately addressed by a manager you were not even talking to. (e.g. saying in a chat ""I am pissed that I am not allowed to request Christmas off"" will be followed by a manager messaging you and saying ""Let's remember to keep things positive!"")
-Your call/phone status is always on a timer.. including going ""idle"" (which is what you have to do if you need to go to the bathroom or something so you don't miss a call) and if you are idle for more than 3 minutes.. well you be contacted by the manager monitoring you that day.
-Your issued iMac is setup to allow a manager to view your screen at any time without notification to you, so you never know when they are looking at your screen. 
-Recorded calls
-Constant feeling of secrets you cannot know, like being assigned new managers every 2-3 months, or having teams broken up and re-assigned for not obvious reason. 

The list gets longer and shorter depending on who your manager is.. some are really invasive and some are really laid back. 

Some other more general cons are:
-little to no flexibility in schedule, it is basically a lottery on what schedule you get and your requests or availability have no way of being addressed. I asked about moving my schedule to accommodate a single college class and I was told there was no way to do that because they ""do not control the scheduling"".
-no break in calls for entirety of shift and no ability to walk away from your at-home desk. 
-Working holidays is required, they actually have a vacation ""blackout"" period that covers the Thanksgiving to Christmas to New Year's period where you are not even allowed to request vacation. 
-Only robotic ways of evaluating performance and being rewarded for good performance so if you are doing well, but the simplistic metric system is unable to analyze that.. then you are not doing well and no further opportunities will be presented to you. 
-Troubleshooting and resolving issues comes last in priorities, with priorities being to keep calls under 15 minutes and manipulate customers into ""feeling"" like they have been helped.. whether you actually solved a problem for them or not. 

I actually think in this position, it is somewhat of a necessary evil, because they are ensuring no time is wasted. With as many employees as they have doing this and for the pay they receive.. it is a requirement to ensure that people aren't just slacking off under no supervision in this at-home environment. However.. personally I find it the environment to feel dehumanizing and exhausting.",Be a little less controlling and manipulative.. it is terrible for morale and fulfillment in this position. I started at Apple because I enjoyed helping people resolve issues on their devices and I found that Apple wanted me to mill through and make people FEEL like that received good service even if it was misleading.

The demand for excellence at Apple made every day a challenge — as well as an opportunity to grow. I was expecting the drive for excellence, but I was surprised to discover just how human and humane 'Apple DNA' is in regards to accepting mistakes and human frailties.

Apple doesn't expect any employee to be perfect, but rather they expect employees to recognize and acknowledge opportunities to improve, and to grow from those experiences. What they do expect of you as an employee is that you show up to work alert, aware, and engaged in your mission. It's definitely not a environment where you can expect to just 'phone it in' metaphorically speaking.

In my 10+ year career at various  Apple Stores I had numerous opportunities to act as a Mentor, facilitating new employee training and onboarding. I would always tell my new employees this: You won't lose your job for making mistakes — not if you apply yourself to acknowledging the opportunity it presents, and grow from it. In fact, I witnessed countless instances that make me believe that Apple values our ability to grow from our mistakes far more than they value our infallibility. I think most of those in leadership positions at Apple believe that if you never make any mistakes then you're probably not trying hard enough.

Yes, you do have to consistently be at the top of your game to have a successful career at Apple, but if you show up everyday ready to do the best work of your life, it's hard not to find yourself genuinely appreciated and rewarded through your efforts.","Working at Apple retail is an extremely high-pressure experience. The demand for service is non-stop. Apple Stores are always busy. Customers would frequently ask me, ""When aren't you this busy?"" My standard humorous response was, ""When we're closed!"" I'd say it with a wink and a smile, but it was essentially the truth!

Out of a 10+ year career at various Apple Stores, I spent about four years as a mobile-device certified technician, (a Family Room Specialist, or FRS for short). Eventually, the daily pressure of dealing with customers' issues with their Apple technology got to be too stressful for me, and I needed to take a medical leave. My store's leadership was very helpful and supportive of me throughout this period, and when I returned even allowed me to transfer to a less stressful sales position (a Specialist in Apple's terminology) without any negative consequences. I was able to speak openly with my coworkers about my anxiety attacks, and never felt unsafe doing so.",

- often cannot attend holidays, kids or school functions bc of the over demanding role requirements
- upper management being brought in is not aligned with Apple values, taking business objectives and goals from Apple trying to implementing it internally which leads to stressed out over worker employees who either get fired or leave.
- the pay is not competitive for how much you end up working. On average a AppleCare manager works 12-14 hours daily. Yearly reviews are too harshly weighted resulting in barely 1-3% annual increases.
- advancement is tricky. If you want to move into leadership it’s not common knowledge to speak the Apple lingo and spend time frequently networking with upper management. You can spend months or years doing this before being selected for a simple rotation in the next role.
- Most of your managers time is spent managing attendance because the hourly employees don’t show up to work. Caliber of hourly employee hired are extremely low way different then the store employees for sure.",Focus on what it will take to re-align with Apples culture.

All training, including your initial training, is done from home.

Part-time employees get some full-time employee benefits, including medical and life insurance.  There is paid time off, and paid time off for family issues such as sick kids, death in the family, etc.  These are all good things for your family, no doubt about it.

Most of the customers you’ll deal with are “normal” people who legitimately need help and will appreciate the time you spend with them resolving their issues.

The starting pay isn’t bad at all.  You can get extra hours at times.

You’ll build good experience you can put on your resume.","Remeber this if you apply for this position:  Customers will yell at you from time to time, and you have almost no recourse or backing from management if you hang up on them.  Apple’s policy toward irate customers is essentially suck it up and let them yell, which will lead to bad customer surveys for you, which will wreck your stats, which will impact your raises and your position in the quarterly shift bid process.  This policy enables the kind of person who has learned they can bully their way into anything they want and helps cause this behavior to become increasingly a societal norm.  It doesn’t take many of these types of customer calls to make you forget about all the others that went really well.

Your first two levels of management are going to be hit or miss.  You’ll love the good ones, and hope you can outlast the rest of them.  Take a wild guess at which group is the larger.

You will work 8 hours on either Saturday or Sunday.  Make sure you can deal with this and its impact on your time with your family.  You will be required to surge to full-time 2 or 3 times each year, and one of those will be for Christmas from about 2 weeks before through 2 weeks after.  Be ready for this impact on your time with family on holidays.  Full-time surges often come with (mandatory) overtime as well.","Promote people to management based on merit, not “diversity.”  Your employees hear what you say, but they also see what you do, and they remember how your actions impact them.  They know when your words and actions don’t match.

Make a stand for civility, instead of whatever feel-good liberal cause floats your boat on a given day.  If customers learn that they won’t get help if they treat your employees like crap, they’ll stop treating them like crap when they call.  Maybe theyll stop treating other people that way, too.  If your employees know you have their back when they get the joy of dealing with an irate customer, they’ll probably make an honest effort to try to get through the anger and solve the customer’s issue.  They’ll respect you for the backing, too.

Fix the broken shift-bid process before your employees start embracing the idea of unionizing in order to fix it for you.  Portions of your workforce might seriously embrace it, even if they don’t like other things about unions.

I work in New York City and I make $18.50 an hour before taxes. The amazing pay is actually also a con, because it's the way they trap you into not looking for other jobs (there are not that many part-time jobs that pay this much).
-Related: the benefits are amazing. Great health, dental, and visual insurance. They pay for a portion of your tuition, if you are a student. They pay part of your phone bill - I have the T-Mobile Individual Unlimited plan, which is usually $75/month, and with Apple it's $25/month! They even pay $100 a month for 
your friggin' transportation!!
-On purpose, they hire people who are either interesting or smart or funny or friendly or have good personalities. As a result, an unusually high percentage of your co-workers (as related to most customer service jobs) are people you will want to know and be friends with. This makes the soul-sucking, ultra-capitalistic work environment vaguely more tolerable and enjoyable.","-You will be subject to something called Net Promoter Score, which is straight out of an episode of Black Mirror. This is where customers rate you out of five stars and leave comments; if a customer gives you five stars they are a ""promoter,"" four stars and they are ""passing,"" less than that and they are a ""detractor."" Did I mention that the managers read literally all of the comments you get, and routinely bring them up? It's incredibly obnoxious.
-You will CONSTANTLY AND CONSISTENTLY be blamed for things that are not your fault. I have had customers blame me for misinformation which I got directly from my managers. 
-For the most part, the managers are horrible and do not care about you, or even their own jobs. They care about money and that's literally it.
-A tip for women: the company is ridiculously misogynistic. Every time I visit the Genius Bar I notice that there are something like 20 men working there to 3 women. Am I supposed to believe that that's a coincidence? Also, I am a female who worked in an IT position for a year and I was given the specialist role, whereas my male friend who has never worked in tech was given technical specialist.
-The company is also racist. A recent product was a line of Beats headphones called the ""Neighborhood Collection,"" which was ""inspired by the urban environment"" (a verbatim quote I had to hear every day for about two weeks). The colors the headphones came in were red, blue, and ""army green."" Also, again, the vast majority of Genius Bar employees are white or East Asian.","Actually care about your employees, train them properly so they stop getting detractors based on lack of product knowledge, stop hiring Genius Bar employees based on their sex and race, stop being insanely condescending to specialists every minute of every day."

Schizophrenic upper and middle management, changing priorities constantly and treating engineers like disposable resources.  Release goals are often unachievable, and code is often hurriedly thrown together.  Software quality suffers as a result.
Poor facilities: employees often have no place to park, and are all but required to eat at the on-campus cafeteria (which is not free) to avoid losing parking spots.  It wasn't uncommon to have to spend 30 minutes hunting for parking in residential Cupertino after getting back from a doctor's appointment.  Campus is generally overcrowded with work environments that aren't conducive to productivity.","Focus on smaller, more achievable sets of features that can be delivered with high quality.

Rewarding experiences and lots of skills to be utilized in the real world (Apple Retail is not the real world, as much as they say it is)...Tim Cook is also trying really hard to correct the company but Retail and Corporate hate one another.","First and foremost, transparency and accountability. The hiring process is a bag of nonsense. Even internally, when you apply for a lateral transfer or a position inside your own store, the management lies to you about your chances with impunity, the Store Leader has no clout with the recruiting process yet promises upward mobility. 

There is favoritism, avarice, and a highly political nature to all hiring decisions. The customers are either incredible or absolutely horrible. This job requires the highest extreme of negotiation skills, customer service, and tolerance as people will test you beyond your limits with what they expect and require. 

Apple Retail needs to clean sweep its management tier, the majority of whom were hired from Wal-Mart, Best Buy,  Target and Pacsun...companies that share no values with Apple and love to focus on numbers. Having worked under Steve Jobs and Ron Johnson, the philosophy used to be ""work on customer experience, because the products sell themselves"" but now it is all about results even though we don't make any commission (which is insane if you do the math) and the management brags about results and company wealth while the average employee is required to know skills required for 80k tech support and IT  jobs while paying them half or less than that and asking them to perform harder on top of those unfeasible numbers.

So many people work obsessively for fear of being judged an under-performer rather than b/c they are truly passionate about their work. EXCESSIVE email, phone calls, meetings, and travel. Internal work flow is rarely efficient/elegant. Most work is accomplished through brute force and shear will of ICs. Key decisions continuously deferred, and very often, past the last minute with team members having to develop contingency on contingency to address management's inability to pare down options. Too many [wannabe] leaders and not enough role players. Firefighters are promoted; planners who work to avoid fires in the first place are often forgotten. Too many teams who want to tackle everything under the sun without adjusting expectations, rather than focus on the big hitters that the team can actually execute well and sustainably.

Unequal enforcement of policy. Leadership puts their personal benefit in front of customers and employees and frequently bump their repairs to the front of the repair line and cover repairs out of warranty.","Practice what you preach. Empower your employees to take care of your customers. Take care of your employees and they will take care of your customers. It is better for customers to keep a well trained employee than it is to hire untrained employees especially when you take into consideration that new employees are starting at higher pay and the expense to train them. High turnover rate is a better indicator of employee happiness than any survey. And lastly, either fire all leadership and start fresh or require all leadership to take sensitivity training."

I needed a change and just wanted a job to get by while I figured out what to do with my useless journalism degree.

I started as a Family Room Specialist.
- Apple trained me in hardware and software troubleshooting for iOS devices
- Pay was pretty O.K. at $16 an hour, considering most other retail/customer service won't pay you that at base starting

After some hard work- you can't just chill, it is very competitive -  I was promoted to a Mac Genius. 
- They gave me insane amounts of training, sent me to Cupertino, and gave me a $10 an hour raise.

Main pros summary:
- Apple gave me invaluable experiences in peer to peer communication and customer service 
- They gave me technical training that I never would have had the opportunity to get without them.
- They sent me to Cupertino for three weeks, all expenses paid. I got the opportunity to be on Apple campus with engineers(inspiring)
- AMAZING benefits. Health insurance. 401k matching. Stocks. Gym memberships. Discounts. You name it.

Because of Apple, I became passionate about coding. I am now working as an iOS Developer full time and absolutely in love with it. I can definitely say this would never have happened without Apple.","- The Mac Genius salary should be better. They lose a lot of talent and passionate people because of that.
- They no longer offer California Genius training. You now do it online. No inspiring Cupertino trip.
- Management became so stringent and numbers based that you barely had more than 5 minutes for an appointment and were often worked beyond mental capacity by being forced to troubleshoot 3 customer's devices at once(customers also hated this).

There is a major focus owning your journey and development. Those that are self-motivated can objectively look at their skill set and focus in on particular behaviors that create success or opportunity. There is a self-sustaining culture of feedback that will test those behaviors - your team will provide feedback on your actions and their impact, and you will find yourself returning the favor quite often. The killer feature of this system is the assumption of positive intent, which allows us to have conversation about the negative impacts more openly. 

There is also a lot of ambiguity, which contributes greatly to our success. While there are rules and policies, we use them as a guide to make the best decision in the moment. Those that are used to rules and black and white may struggle to make a critical decision in the moment.

The people you work with are brilliant and utilize talents outside of the store environment that will always impress. I've watched so many people excel at their job and do great things, building skills for life and next career choices.
Benefits and compensation, despite what people say, are generous if used to their fullest. Most employees neglect the extras and focus only on the base salary.","Working in the retail store is challenging because of the odd hours that retail requires. However, managers are willing to work with teams to find the best out of retail scheduling chaos. 
Senior leaders may not always have the Apple knowledge base when they first start out and this makes it challenging to lean on them completely. Big picture, Apple hires great talent for these positions. 
It has become harder and harder for managers to expand out of their roles and learn and develop new skill sets outside of the retail four walls. Gaining career experience opportunities can be challenging as the requirements for many relevant step ups require that you be a store leader first, which just reinforces the idea of climbing up a ladder, something that culturally does not sit well with how we do business in general, especially at the Retail level.","Continue to support leaders in the stores and provide resources to aide them. They want to do fantastic things but are stretched thin constantly. At the retail stores, we try to create special moments for our employees and our customers. Corporate needs to try to create magical Apple moments across the board for our teams as well. 
Also, there should be internal recruiters who are looking out for above and beyond talent in our retail stores and seeking to challenge and deepen their responsibilities across the company. Leaders in the store don't always know what would be a best fit for other roles across the company. Sometimes retail is the in for many employees but unless people feel continuously challenged over time, they start seeking an out."

At the time, there were many tremendous features, but there were certainly items that stood out as pain points. Then, month after month, year after year, the pain points were either removed or improved upon until the products were simply (far) superior to anything else I'd ever seen or used.

While there, they will make you feel very welcome and included. Your ideas will be listened to, and they'll make you feel valued. Plus the benefits are some of the best in the field.","Apple is slowly and visibly gravitating from a innovative professional hardware and software company to a fashion company. Speaking from a retail perspective, many employees in the past were experienced working professionals who had deep knowledge in their respective fields be it photography, audio engineering, or filmmaking. What an employee lacked in knowledge or for upcoming software changes, Apple management and department leads made sure you were given ample development time to grow and learn. The structure then was unofficially to inspire your customers, and the sales will follow.

As time progressed, Apple leadership put more emphasis on ""people leaders"" who had poor knowledge of the product. As such, many of these new ""people leaders"" brought in from companies like Starbucks, Best Buy, Target, etc. didn't and still don’t share those same values as their passionate employees. Over time, the professionals working for the company became burned out and moved on, either by their own accord or a manager's. To fill the places of these working professionals were employees with no professional background, given little practical training on the software they were to learn resulting in having employees with poor knowledge on the product or subject if questions arose. The Apple professionals remaining in the company became complacent and/or bitter that they were being paid similar amounts as those newer employees with lesser experience, yet they were expected to assist with their deeper knowledge when a customer required it. This effect cause these professionals to exploit Apple's attendance policies resulting in less staff during a planned out day. A great example is seeing the Genius Bar become so famously behind. A lot of that is due to staff calling out for their shifts leaving their peers and lower ranking employees to pick up the pieces and learn-on-the-fly. When these problematic staff members were set to be confronted, they'd go out on leave-of-absence through stress or some sort of injury and return once the dust settles on their attendance record. This is a very deep problem Apple has yet to permanently resolve today.  

What has since become noticed and evident is how most of Apple’s newest leaders are not inspirational tech professionals. They don’t develop you to want to use the platform or software. They weren’t promoted through the ranks, but were rather hired outside the company and brought in. They’re most interested in taking you through leadership development for a few months at your same rate then throwing you back into your old responsibilities with little to show for what you’d learned. The bulk of their leaders don’t even know how to use a word processor, build a spreadsheet, or even edit a photo. They’re there to coach on sales, inspire performance, and defuse customer escalations (overriding whatever fair resolution you had positioned to your customer). It’s not the Apple environment it once was, and has slowly gravitated into a sales organization first. Sell first, then invite them back to a workshop to be inspired later.","Go back to formula. Leads were the lifeblood of Apple who deeply understood the products inside and out. They understood where their teams were at in their development, and knew which employees in the store knew the product. Leaving this up to store management is a poor idea, as many couldn't be trusted to run tap water efficiently."

Also be honest about how ""high up"" someone can go in Apple retail. There is very well a ceiling in place for employees. Apple managers like to ignore this or just deny it, but its true.

If you are an intelligent and creative minded individual, for all its benefits, staying in Apple Retail IS NOT easily sustainable.

IF you do get your request by luck, then you will absolutely work an opening shift the following day. thats that 8am shift the day after you want to have off. Expect to work every weekend unless you consistently kiss the toes of management.

 they outsource positions with titles and don't often promote within. if they do promote you from within you will not see any kind of increase in pay, just enough to say hey you get a dollar more.

The company may pile in resources to make the deadline.","1) Incompetent middle managements, at least in the department I worked.  They lack of technical know-how and leadership, to command the projects and the team. 

2) Low productivity. Since the management does not know how to work smart and efficiently, they had hard time keeping up with the industry. They always sought forcing team to work in a counter-productive way, to constantly work overtime and often doubling resources for the same work (while  still had hard time making the deadline). A good engineer would find his time was mostly wasted on fixing symptoms, doing projects that were never completed or added no value.
 
3) Heavily politicized and lack of integrity. The management defended their incompetence by politicizing and siloing. They refused admitting poor results (let alone listening advices, learning or improving).  They promoted and rewarded their ""own guys"" who followed their agenda. They coerced (often made up) bad reviews on talent engineers who focused on results. A typical tactics is to make their unfavorables as scapegoats for their own failures.

Overall it's a toxic environment, at least in the engineering portion I worked in. I am not surprised to see fewer innovations from Apple now.  Covering by its secrecy, Apple engineering is on a slippery slope down.

Nice facilities. Fast paced work makes the day go by fast. Some opportunities for movement within the company.,"Politics and maneuvering at middle-management levels. Work was too silo-ed with little ""big picture"" or strategy view, which made it feel ""claustrophobic"". 
There are clusters of people from other companies (ex: Microsoft) which are trying to ""put the band back together"" at Apple, and wasting time on empire building. HR is not paying attention and the ""Apple way"" is slowly getting diluted.
Many employees seem to only stay for the stock, and are looking/hoping for a better opportunity. They are not happy in their current roles. 
The secrecy makes it difficult to learn much about other internal opportunities. The generic job descriptions for internal opportunities make it hard to know if you'd like another role better, if it's worth changing roles.
Smart people, but most don't come in as experts in the job they were hired for. The interview does not reveal the nature of the work, and young talent is favored over experience. 
The new folks do their best, but often they don't feel productive or valuable/satisfied. I have watched engineers who are smart but young, as they ""discover"" the same solutions I've already worked on before because. It's a bit sad to see people believe they're re-invented the wheel, and it's wasteful & boring for those who went through the experience before. It drags down progress to wait for the young folks earn their stripes, instead of allowing experienced folks to push ahead. I can only assume that management thinks the younger engineers will come up with some bright idea for doing the same thing better. It rarely happens. Alternatively, maybe because Apple can't pay for talent, maybe they hope to raise it.","Hire candidates with experience in the area they will be working in. 
Be careful of empire-building going on in your organization, as it can be distracting and demoralizing, and dilutes ""the Apple way"".
Give HR more power to help individual contributors, not just managers.
Allow groups to share their strategy and vision more broadly, to build that ""we're all in this together"" feeling."

The longer you work here, the worse you're treated - The apple juice will wear off as with any job and people that are beyond competent in their jobs and who excel will be overlooked for promotions/career experiences by new hires who kiss a**. Pay is also pretty equal for people that have been in a position for years with someone that was just hired. There is no reward for sticking with the company whatsoever.
No Work/Life Balance - Operations always gets screwed over with the algorithms for shifts. People have preferences for shift times/days, give it to tenured employees first then fill with part-time as needed, as with most other companies. It doesn't make sense.
Management is inept - Some are good but others almost make it their mission to throw their direct reports under the bus because they don't know what they are doing. This would be alleviated if management was hired from within, as well as from within departments.
No real career mobility - It is near impossible to move forward unless you kiss a**, orgasm the ""Apple culture"" and management wants to sleep with you (which has happened at my store.
Apple culture is deteriorating - This goes back to corporate. Everything is $$$ now at the expense of employees while top executives make a killing and gift us $5 T-shirts and a printing of the Apple Credo as a Christmas gift.

We do the day to day work, we know how things run. You are losing your best employees which is why new hires are subpar in comparison to years ago.

And a great conversation starter.  Also the benefits are top notch.  I work from home, so this is definitely a pro (and sometimes a con) as well.  Also if you like to buy Apple products the discounts that you get are pretty decent.","Where do I start?  'All that glitters is not gold'; 'The grass isn't always greener on the other side'.  These are a few sayings that come to mind when people say they want to work for Apple.  If you work in Applecare, you are a call center worker.  No matter how they dress it up to you.  Chat, Email or Phones.  It's a call center, so comes with it the cons of working in a call center.

Shift Scheduling - Is absolutely abysmal.  Depending on your department, you'll have to change your schedule in a little as every 3 months or 6 months. So say goodbye to any obligations you have outside of work, because when a shift is assigned to you.  It's yours, and you have to work it.  Yes, they try to sugar coat and say you can swap with someone else, but if it's already a crazy shift to begin with, nobody else is going to want it.

Work life Balance - Where? At the time of this writing you get no holidays off in Applecare (or weekends depending on your schedule).  When I first started, you did.  But now, nada.  365 days a year the queues are opened. However management (your manager) gets these days off (and weekends). How nice.

Work tools - Will never work properly.  I've never worked at a company where there was so many issues with work tools.  The kicker is you'll still need to be able to assist the customers and expected to get awesome CSATs with non-working tools.  

Micromanagement - You'll never do anything right.  If it's not one thing, it's another.  Your manager will find fault in anything that you do, it's expected.  Good calls or chats will still be nit picked and have endless ""one on ones"" on discussing how it could have been done better. They even have it written in policy on how long you are allowed to take bathroom breaks. Yep, even when you work from home.

Policy and Procedures - Can and will change without notice.You are told how to do something, you do it.  A few months later it's wrong and should never be done like that.  And when you ask why or when it was changed. No one can give you a straight answer.  They'll give you the typical 'Apple BS giving you an answer, but not really answering your question' answer (with a smile on their face).  Those that work in Applecare will know exactly what I'm referencing too.  

Final thoughts.  Management loves to ""cheerlead"" you through this muck of a work environment. They know what we have to go through isn't ideal and outright sucks, but they ignore it and speak to you like everything that is happening to you is good and we should be thankful for what Apple is doing for us. It's borderline ""cult like"". It's like serving you dog poop on a gold plate with gold utensils, and they try to convince you that it's good for you.","Nothing.

I have been blessed with great work environments in my life. Apple retail has amazing and diverse people. If it were just up to hanging with my coworkers, doing great work and having fun I'd be running to work to be there every day. 

Apple will provide some great tools that can be used in your personal life and later professional life. If you follow how they teach it their perspectives on ""Fearless feedback and assuming positive intent"" can be incredibly useful. 

If you are young and can get in it's a great place to start, learn some skills move up a little, if you can, and then use it as a resume stuffer.","This is Apple Retail - its not really Apple. They would like you to believe that the company is one big family but the retail side is kind of a step child. The vacation structure is different as are benefits. There is NO PROFIT SHARING. and also no commission. So even if you individually do 1million in sales, you still get just your salary. 

They do not value experience or tenure. They appreciate it, like pat on the back 'great job' appreciate. But do not value it. There is no significant compensation other than additional vacation time for high levels of experience. That being the case it is good to get out sooner rather than later. They do not cultivate and give incentives for people to stay. The longer you stay, with no upward movement, the more demoralized you will get.  

Tenure and Experience and Hard work DO NOT equal promotion. Apple managers have a secret recipe on who they favor or do not. If you do not fit into a management team's vision, YOU WILL NOT PROGRESS. PERIOD. It is possible to move up and sometimes dramatically if you do fit what they want. I have seen both very worthy and very unworthy (based on their effectiveness after promotion) people promoted. 

Management is often hired from outside the company which causes a severe cultural mismatch and tremendous frustration. Potential leaders are not developed and people from outside with managers titles who might not click with Apple values are brought in on a regular basis. 

Apple essentially asks you to develop yourself. That goes for managers on down. That is an upside for people who use the Apple language and style and live it, sometimes like an automaton. However if you do not speak their development language and feed it back to them, even if you have vast leadership potential they have no way to cultivate you. I've seen people with incredible potential bypassed, grow demoralized and leave because the company cannot find ways to develop people internally, They generally overburden managers and employees so any possible time you have for development is taken away or you have to essentially not do your job and overburden others to make time to do the development things they ask. 

The company improves their systems which is helpful but essentially is only trying to make everyone (on the technical support side) take more and more people. Work in the technical support side is a thankless job often and more than it was. You are asked to help more and more people while somehow connecting personally and not making it ""transactional"". And often the customers are great but they can also be awful. Not know which you'll get EVERY 10-15 minutes!! Is emotionally draining day after day. And with managers who've never done the job they don't understand the emotional toll the job takes. 

I appreciated my time at Apple but hit a number of walls of demoralization. As did most of the amazing people around me, managers included. I managed to reinvigorate myself but with every leadership change you are essentially at square one again having to re-build your credibility. I probably should have gotten out sooner but Apple Retail also has a way of sucking you in for longer than you expect... it can get comfortable because of the amazing co-workers.","to be successful a company need to cultivate and reward deep institutional knowledge. People who have been somewhere a long time can give insight and depth that constant new employees, moving them in, up and out cannot give. Apple sales, service and moral in general suffers because of it. NPS goes down. 

Come up with development strategies that actually value different management styles not gust one that are heavy on ""command skills"" and regurgitation of Apple Speak... (Lominger) 

Reward people commensurately with their tenure and value tenure in general. A significant pay increase to senior staff would go a long way for retention as would PROFIT SHARING. 

Build in some inefficiency so employees can breath and regain their emotional energy trying to help frustrated and angry customers. Sometimes too much efficiency sucks the life (personal connection, helping others) out of the room. 

Sadly after 15 years it seems to be getting worse. The new roles announced as I was leaving sounded like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. 

The best three things you can do serious compensation increases, better development (with direct actual led development) and profit sharing (better incentives)

Much more common is the sort of manager who feels insecure and considers his/her reports to be competitors, and prevents them from contributing effectively. Such managers feel under pressure to provide all the innovation themselves, and actively suppress anything from below. Of course that won't stop them from giving their reports negative performance reviews for failing to innovate. If you get this sort of manager you will find you have no voice.

Your customers generally love seeing you.  There is a great variation of different roles in each store so it's fairly easy to find one that suits your personality.

Benefits are, by and large, better than just about any retail organization out there.  Standards are high and this tends to produce a very rewarding day to day experience for employees and customers.","There is absolutely no blueprint or roadmap for advancement.  This means you'll spend frustrating amounts of time trying to meet this quarter's ad hoc development goals only to learn that the focus has shifted in an entirely different direction next quarter.  You'll find promises are plentiful, but opportunities far, far less so.  It's not at all infrequent for people in leadership positions at other companies to be promised a fast-track into Apple Retail's leadership ranks but, too often, once you've taken the bait there isn't much you can do to move upward.

Internal promotions are exceedingly rare so don't be surprised when you find yourself working for a manager hired externally from another retailer or even a fast food restaurant.  Apple has quietly de-emphasized growth training and is now focussed on throughput at the expense of all else, including employee and customer satisfaction.  

From a products and services standpoint Apple has done very little of late to cause excitement.  If you're on the support side of things expect frequent laments from customers about the degradation of Apple's products.  Frequent recalls, abrupt cancellations of favorite services, and a general feeling that we've been here before.  Apple has trod on its reputation for so long now that it almost seems quaint to recall the days when hundreds of people would line up for days in anticipation of a new product launch.","No one like disingenuousness from their leadership.  Be frank, be fair, and above all else be honest.  Far too much of your time is spent on selling the business to your employees.  They're already sold.  That's why they've agreed to accept poor pay (let's be honest: who among your staff can readily afford much of what's for sale in your store?) and odd schedules."

We're all expected to know this language and if we do not speak in such terms our points are cast aside and our voices are not heard. We're also reprimanded for not using said language. 

Though we are paid slightly above other retailers, there is so much more involved that it's insulting to call us just retail workers. I've worked retail many times prior to apple, and it's a different ballgame entirely. As a whole, we are not paid enough for what we do. We're overworked, exhausted, and disenchanted. Apple has neglected their people over the past year in a massive way. It's heartbreaking.","Spend more time fostering the individual development of your people. Turnover is high for a reason. Unfortunately there's a never ending supply of inspired, bright eyed post grads who want to take our place, so that's not a concern to the higher ups.

AppleCare is open 365 days a year, so don't expect to be able to spend the holidays with family and friends.
They don't give support advisors who support the iPhone an iPhone, as a result many advisors supporting the iPhone have never used one.

-Even if you have IT certifications or lots of knowledge leadership still may not want you to use those skills outside of your main job duties because that's not ""part of your role anymore"" or ""will never be part of the role""
-Your role can be challenging at first due to lots of knowledge of company policies or product information but over time gets very tedious (say after 1 year) and makes it boring for you to stay with company unless you get promoted which is quite difficult
-Company Policies change so much that there's lots of ambiguity on handling a situation for customer support.
-At the retail level it's really just a customer support job that uses technology as it's medium.  In short it's stressful because Apple takes a customers side first over yours even if it's not fair like the old saying ""customer is always right"" most of the time.

They offer 401k and stock options, as well as donating to any nonprofit you may volunteer for. Apple is fantastic to work for.","The retail management is really rough for the most part. They bring in people from other retail companies, not realizing that none of these people know what our day to day jobs are. We have to explain technology to customers daily, and yet our management knows barely anything about technology. They are simply the mouth puppets of whoever is running the ""corporate values"" side of Retail. At Corporate, there is nothing like this, but in Retail they discuss ""competencies"" and more to sound like their boring management means something. They don't care about development for each employee, they just care about their salary and making sure customers don't get upset. There are a few managers who get it, but not enough to make a difference. Apple really needs to change the way they pick their retail managers.","Choose a much better way to find retail management. I get that tech people don't want to manage a retail store, but a lot of management doesn't get respect because they haven't earned it."

-Decent benefits
-Work from home","-Too driven by numbers and not the end result.
-False promises.
-Horrible scheduling issues. - moved half the staff to iTunes then kept them there after they told them they would be coming back leaving the chat department under water for MONTHS! 
-Depending on your boss, there is alot of micro managing. My boss was pretty cool but i heard otherwise from co-workers. 
-Taking 3 chats at a time for tech support is just too much. It's doable sometimes but when they were slammed for those few months that drove me to quit, it was busy with 3 chats+ all day for 10 hours and most everyone was upset because they had to wait, etc etc etc. 
-There are different rules and procedures based on the country the customer is in, causing confusion because previous reps never verified the customer location and they would get upset when they were offered an option that they did not qualify for because they live in the wrong country. 
-During that busy time, they kept telling us that they were going to fix the scheduling issues, but instead they purposely let people go home on VTO so the reps who stuck it out, were stuck on 3 chats all day just to save some money. 
-No dispute process for unfair survey scores. 
-Development was not taken seriously in my opinion. Many of my chats were reviewed but I was never given any constructive feedback on the surveys that fell under and was told I did everything I could. Well if I did what I could then there should be a process to turn over that survey as it was out of my control and providing a feedback link does nothing for the customer.
-Previous supervisor reviews, wouldn't fully read my chats and just assume that I did not meet my commitments. I had to constantly read through all my reviews and submit corrections because they were being missed for not having enough time to go over my chats. If you don't have time for a rep's performance improvement and development, how the heck are you expecting them to improve? 
-During that busy time (which they said would only last a few weeks, turned into months) this was not even during a launch period. meetings and trainings that were required were being canceled but somehow we were expected to complete them while being on 3+ chats at a time. 
-They wanted reps to go above and beyond but with it being so busy there was literally almost no time to stand out unless you had 4 hands. I had to do many of my extra projects and presentation preps during my breaks/lunches and off time because the environment was too busy and stressful during scheduled work time. 
-Systems didn't work properly all the time and were poorly structured. My last job literally had one hub that we would go to for troubleshooting and then go from there. Apple wants to be different and have 1000's of articles that we have to search find through quickly when many of them had too many steps that didn't fix the issue causing a poor customer experience. I ended up using google for 90% of my research and I had better luck fixing issues then using their internal systems.","You took the fun out of working from home. When I first started in 2015, it was awesome. It wasn't as busy and it was spaced out enough where I could research, and learn, etc etc. Not sure what changed in 2016, but dear god... we are just money making machines to you. I might as well have worked in a sweat shop. This might have been worse. I took a pay cut for this job and then for you guys to have it constantly busy and high stress where it's unbearable. I was happy to quit. I came from a previous employer very similar who was only focused on numbers and money and didn't care of the opinions of the staff. I guess you guys are going the same route. I love the products but your service has gone down hill. Also, all expectations should be across the entire enterprise not only for specific regions. Everytime I contact Apple Support, they never once used the whole sequencing acknowledge, align jumbo you guys forced down our throats. So much happier without you guys. They pretend to care, but they truly can care less. Once you stop drinking that Apple Juice, you will see the light too. A weight has been lifted off my shoulders now that I'm free from this place."

- BEST medical, dental, vision, life insurance benefits I ever came across.  Compared to every other company  I worked for no one comes close to Apple's benefits.  The dentist I used actually mentioned that they never had any patient with as high dental coverage as the plan Apple ensures.

- Very challenging.  If your going for a promotion your NOT competing against nobodies.  These are some of the most intelligent, innovative and hard working people I know in my life.  It made promotions a real challenge but that's a good thing I think.  Makes you work harder and appreciate what you get.

- Good 401k and stock options.  Apple has some great 401k and stock options, again I haven't seen any other company I worked for offer such benefits.

- Great discounts on products.  A good example of this is I paid $1,000 for a $2,000 iMac.  Some co workers bought a MacBook Air that costed $999 and paid less than $300.  

- Caring company.  I couldn't believe this but it's true.

But when we got a new store leader who wanted us to - sell sell sell - and cared little for employees the attrition rate in the store SKYROCKETED.

Mostly decent people, but not a day went by without being insulted, harassed, or yelled at by someone. When they aren't rude, they are needy and expect to have their hand held through all troubleshooting, and you are on strict timelines to keep your calls short. This is mostly to be expected in customer service, but Apple is so busy that you find yourself going through this back to back to back to back with little chance to breath. Scheduling changes every 3 months, and it's left up to chance- like a lottery, unless you are a top performer, in which case you can choose your schedule. Being a top performer isn't easy, and the criteria is strict. Your call handling is monitored, critiqued, and micromanaged down to the tiniest details. You are in a break or after call time for 20 seconds too long, and a manager is checking on you to see what's going on. Some people excel at jobs like this, for the rest of us, it is exhausting. The stress began to take a toll on my mental and physical health. I was an Apple Store employee for 7 years, but I only last for 1 as an Apple care advisor.

When I left apple care, all of the huge problems we were facing could be boiled down to one thing: we were too busy. The number of Apple users has exploded exponentially over the last few years and apple refuses to expand the stores and number of Apple care employees to match the growing number of customers. We were always swamped, our offline time to catch up on emails and news was cancelled every week, our managers were breathing down our necks to take more calls, the customers were angry to be waiting on hold for an hour then getting rushed through the call. It was a horrible work environment, we all felt like drones. I know that this is not the culture apple wants to have, or at least the culture they lie about having. Apple- you have so much money.

2. Good food that's not terribly expensive. 
3. Decent pay for a technical writer.
4. People were fairly friendly, on the whole.
5. Great fringe benefits for full-timers (not for contractors), including a gym, on-site doctor, and other services.
6. You don't take your work home with you, as a contractor.
7. From what I can tell, Apple actually cares about its employees, and it tries to be a responsible corporation. That counts for something. A lot, really. My previous employer was happy to support bigoted political candidates just for the ""pro-business"" policies. I don't see Apple doing that. I do see it giving me a place to safely dispose of batteries, recycling waste on a huge scale, and building giant solar farms.","1. This was some of the dullest work I've ever done. At the Austin location, most work seems to revolve around helping Apple-associated repair shops do paperwork. I wrote a lot of processes about things like explaining to an Apple keyboard jockey how to replace incorrect serial numbers and how to document returned parts—and so forth—to support these repair shops.

2. It can be impossible to get away from deficient personality types, and that can screw up organizational functioning. I had the misfortune to get saddled with the smuggest, most pedantic—and yet still unfriendly—person I have ever met. The kind of person who can't distinguish between ""can"" and ""may,"" but who will take a paragraph to critique your use of ""who,"" instead of ""whom."" The kind of guy who makes his neck tendons stand out from strain when he's trying to make an ordinary point about a slideshow in a meeting. There's no need for that kind of inanity in a clock-punching job. Anyway, he trained me and occupied the adjacent cube during my entire tenure. And because he dug himself in, there was no way to get away from him, even though it was clear to my supervisors and coworkers that this guy was an obstacle, regardless of how hard he worked. Everyone hated him, but there he is, immovable.

3. Apple is Byzantine. More arcane than you'd dare guess, and yet there's not an organizational chart to be found. Ask for one, and you get a weird oral history recounting the succession of lords and ladies in the various sub-departments. But not, say, a hierarchy of departments and brief descriptions of their functions. This makes it unnecessarily difficult to figure out how the organization works. 

4. Good luck getting access to the systems you need to do your job! I never got access to some of the systems I was actually writing processes for! Many times! Unbelievable.","1. Honestly, from what I saw, y'all are doing all right. My supervisor was good, though the system as a whole needs tinkering ...

2. For the love of human sanity, sketch out a rough organizational chart. If you don't know what that is, research it on the Internet. 

3. Do more to identify deficient personality types. They drive away quality people, and they damage the overall pace of work through their effect on morale. Once you identify one, assign him to a solo project away from normal people. You know, quarantine. Don't have him training anyone.

4. Figure out how to get technical writers (even contractors) access to the systems they'll need for doing their jobs, even if they're just writing about using those systems, rather than using them directly."

Of all the places I've ever worked (10 years of customer service and technical support), this one is the most demanding mentally.

Extremely poor work life balance, especially if you work in chat. They don't schedule well, and they certainly don't hire enough to handle their volume, so you end up doing twice the work for the same pay. Or worse - triple the work which is very common during the holidays. And no - I'm not talking about extra product support - you will support all of their products. I'm talking about volume.

All the while you must maintain a strict level of quality which is measured by customers - which can be great, unless they're upset over something you can't control. And - you guessed it - there's no way to challenge the feedback.

On the days you work you are exhausted from too much over stimulation, and the days you have off (if they're not pushing overtime), you're just trying to recover. Be warned - this is an extremely stressful job and it will effect your day to day life in more ways that just having to be somewhere for a minimum 40 hours a week.

On top of that, it's extremely hard to provide feedback - everyone is focused on positivity rather than reality, and so it's not a very honest environment.

In the time I've been here, I've only seen it change for the worse - never for the better, so my outlook is quite grim.

At Apple, you are not ""hired"", but rather, ""selected"", like a piece of a puzzle, to fit in with the rest of the team. 

Apple focuses on developing you through the trials and tribulations in retail. Being good is simply not enough–so, when the opportunity provides itself to help you become the best, it is always taken. Your peers are there to give you feedback. You are there to implement it. Your leaders are there to do the same, but guide you (or lead you) through the process of growth, while ultimately helping you get to the next position in the store. 

A lot of the skills I have learned here at Apple has bled over into my personal life. I am able to focus a lot more (and block out distractions as well, we know how busy it can get) on the things that matter. 

I have learned to think creatively and strategically. 

I have learned how to communicate passionately and effectively.

I have learned to empathize with upset customers and turn situations around.Even if I am unable to turn the situation around, I have learned to calm my inner self to the point where I do not lash out at customers. I am more vulnerable than ever now. 

If you are looking for a great job, a job where you have another family that helps develop you, while making some great money and reaping some great benefits, then this job is for you. This job is NOT for you if you are not passionate, are not vulnerable, do not want to learn, or do not care about helping others grow.

This job is for the go-getters, the doers, the people who want MORE; the people who want to develop, reach new levels, bring others along on the journey (leadership) and learn technical skills/people skills that open your mind to a whole new level of thinking.","I know, I know, with the above post a lot of people will say, ""Oh, this guy must have drunk the Kool Aid. Honestly, it's not even about that. I do love the company I work for, or else, I would have never applied. No company is perfect, however. The job is incredibly demanding, and draining. Keep reading.

For me, I do not work at a flagship, or avenue store. Chances are, you might not either (if you're selected.) So, a lot of times, when heading to work you might feel like ""Oh, I just work in the mall. Nothing to see here. Just regular customers.""

I can't lie, I have had those thoughts sometimes. But there are ways to help with that. Show up to work a little earlier than expected. maybe 30 minutes. Relax for a bit. get your mind wrapped within the atmosphere. 

Because, truth be told, the job is incredibly demanding...but it's so rewarding. 

Don't be dismayed that you work in a mall. You still work at Apple and you are still enriching lives. It's incredibly fun.

Questions.

Customer's will come in and ask the same questions. Over and over again. And over. And over. Don't get bored. Find new ways to creatively express what iCloud is. Find new ways to show customer's the differences between the iPhones, Macs, or iPads. Let them drive. Don't take over. give them that, and you'll see that they enjoy the interaction more. (I used to be in this section, where you recommend solutions to customers, but have since moved to the Genius Bar.)

As far as the Genius Bar, you will get those customers who are mad. Don't snap on them. Just listen. Let them get it out.  Empathize. Once you listen and stay calm, they become calm. Never match their level. You can't fight fire with fire. Works ALMOST every time. The times that it doesn't work...well, I'll leave that up to you.",Keep doing what you're doing!

Benefits for medical are amazing, you seriously won't beat it. Lots of free software and discounts on third party items in addition to Apple products. Fairly laid back environment regarding the culture, depending on your leadership team of course.","The company used to really focus on developing employees as people, i see a shift now and it's becoming more big box retail which is extremely sad to me. Work/life balance is pretty much zero. You simply can't have balance working retail hours, days, non consecutive days off, the amount of customers we see. All I can say is force yourself to request time off otherwise you will burn out quickly.

Pay. Shighhhhh. For retail maybe it's okay. Except in the Family Room. We're not really retail, we're a giant public IT dept. Considering the knowledge we have and the work we do we're paid very low. Six years later, three as a genius and repeatably told I'm one of the best Genii in the market, my reviews are outstanding and yet I make less than twenty dollars an hour. Please explain how this is even a thing.

The pay spectrum is way off as well. For those of us who came in under John Browett we got screwed starting out at $10/hr. Only a few of us are left but pay wise we'll never get caught up to the new guys starting in the mid teens. Even with the pay bump three years ago that Apple handed out in addition to raises newer, less experienced Genii are making more money per hour. Partly due to when you get a promotion in Apple Retail they increase your pay by a percentage vs. using a baseline amount. This method really is unfair to loyal, good employees and very insulting that new Family Room employees a lot of the time make $2-5/hr more.

The good news is if you're just coming on I would advise you to really wear them out on wanted pay, you'll benefit greatly if you stick to your guns.","Learn the Apple culture. A lot of you come from Target, Gap, SBux or other big box retail. Stop trying to bring your old ways here and embrace what Apple has to offer.

And those of you who are already here … Promote from within. A lot of people work their tails off and deserve to be rewarded for that work. External hires fragment the culture and should be reduced.

Learn what corporate has laid out for Family Room guidelines. Stop making this your own wild west where you make up the rules for what we're going to do as a company.
