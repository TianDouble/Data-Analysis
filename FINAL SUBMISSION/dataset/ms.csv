1,"Jan 28, 2013","""Thoughts after 10 years....""",Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,"Redmond, WA",4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,I have been working at Microsoft full-time for more than 10 years,"1.  If you love tech, this is a great place.  No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2.  What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations.  If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher.  401k match is nice.

3.  Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine.  This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs.  The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either.  You'll get a bonus each year and some stock.  It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume:  After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career:  Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there.  Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company.  Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too.  Not familiar with the stack rank?  Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade"".","I'll type it here - but I don't they are listening...
1.  Help proven talent move laterally in the company for new opportunities.
2.  Kill/evolve the stack rank.  Here's basically how it's viewed:.  30% of the company gets 1s and 2s - and they are happy.  50% get 3s and that basically feels like getting a ""C"" in school.  This sucks for talented people when a multitude of UNCONTROLLABLE conditions keep you from getting into 1 or 2 range.  The 20% getting anything below a 3 are walking dead.  In summary, 70% of the company walk away from the review cycle feeling like crap.  This is no good.

After 10 years, I'm leaving - it's just a matter of time until I find the right opportunity.  I need to find a company spends 90% of it's time building technology experiences, as opposed to 90% of its time building PowerPoints.  And I expect to refuse the exit interview - because if you really cared what I thought, you wouldn't ask me after I decided to leave."

Work-life balance is possible but can be tricky depending on customer location and whether the customer requires 100% onsite (e.g. many Federal customers). Benefits package is actually worthy of comparison when adding to total compensation.  Rewards often match output, especially if you learn what your management/senior leadership are looking to quantify for the region or team's overall performance. 

Access to mentorship can be challenging in Services as opposed to the Engineering or Sales areas, but you have access to most of the company and if you put time into networking, it can definitely be done. Access to some of the best minds and best training in the world, but you need to set good boundaries to balance time spent billable vs training and keeping up. They factor in training time, but you have to schedule it at regular intervals and make sure your customer(s) is/are happy with timing","Challenging for those who have a hard time self-promoting (have to balance between highlighting good/great performance while remaining humble. This is not a company for insanely bright solo performers who have no ability to share their knowledge - a high premium is placed on building upon the success of others (generally not starting from scratch) and promoting the success of others (e.g. build things in such a way that they meet best practices and can be reused in others' projects. In my mind, this aspect is a pro, not a con, but for those who want to go ""lone cowboy genius"" this is not the place for you unless you are really willing to stretch yourself.

While our software is great, our internal tools need work. Things like timekeeping and customer records are accurate but have quirks that make them tedious to use. While management is aggressively looking to replace these, it is slowly progressing. Not the biggest con if you come in expecting it, but it is a bit disappointing given the caliber of the company.

Finally, there are pockets of services where the customer contracts have been written with very little protection for the PFE or Consultant - you may be asked to do something ridiculously out of scope or unreasonable from a man-power/schedule perspective. While this is not generally the case, you will need to network your way through the situation (leverage peer assistance), while working with the Account team to adjust scope. Some contracts may be so bad that you need to quickly rotate out. However, there truly is plenty of opportunity to move around - you are not hired for a single slot like most other services companies.","Fix tools, work on how your contracts are worded to increase customer satisfaction and protection of services employees."

Also, depends on your team but they really just stick you somewhere out of college. No matching based on skills really. Moreover, your manager can be all over. Compared to a startup, you just won't learn or grow as much. A lot of people who are 'comfortable' are here and like just sitting around. Not really any sense of urgency.

Of course it's done verbally behind closed doors and for seemingly unrelated or non-specific reasons, but it's there.  The politeness you see around the company is a thin veneer over the sheer toxicity this company's management has.

The company separates employees into three categories: college hires, industry hires, and internal transfers.  Industry hires are people with experience outside of Microsoft since college. If you're of those then run! They'll treat you like crap. So many good engineers are pushed out of the company.

Judge the CEO by what lower management acts on.  It's not a pretty picture.

This isn’t similar to other companies, this is a constant within Microsoft. Let me give me context.  Yes - MICROSOFT is obsessed with diversity but this also means that often the best qualified person didn’t get the job.  I’ve watched this happen time and time again.  When you interview or “loop” if there isn’t enough diversified candidates then MICROSOFT will redo the interview process - EVEN if a highly qualified candidate was available.  

Every year there’s a high probability you’ll end up in a reorg.  In 5 years I was caught in 4 organizations.  Unproductive and confusing to both employees and customers.  MICROSOFT is not customer obsessed.  Moving roles constantly makes it hard to know your customer well and add value.   Every year my new customers made it a point to let me know how upset they were with the constant shifting.

- Okay starting wage for an entry level position.
- Fun team members.
- Consistent amount of hours (as long as you aren't demanding full time).
- Lots of resources for developing your own skillset and networking. 
- College reimbursement is great for students.","- Working outside of your sales role is discouraged by management, many times that discouragement is indirect. Management tells you that there are no borders in terms of upward mobility and that you're encouraged to work outside your role if you want to move up; This is complete nonsense. Management will discourage this since they are under tight budget constraints and don't have the approval to pay what many of the employees are actually worth if they were to use their full potential. 
- There's a bit of kool-aide in that they talk about your ""Career at Microsoft"", however it is very rare that skilled individuals move up in the store. Promotions and raises seem to be based on diversity hiring tactics and favoritism rather than merit, ability, and professionalism foremost. 
- Depending on who your managers are, they will treat the job like the typical retail experience; The metrics they use to measure success conflict with the message of customer service. This often leads to management pushing product and subscriptions which might not be the best fit for the customer, but is instead most profitable for the store. (Not necessarily Microsoft as a whole).","- Create clear advancement paths for employees, or at least be honest if no openings exist. Management treats the job as a stepping stone on to something else, but seldom says anything other than the scripted ""Career at Microsoft"" talking points. It is not a career at Microsoft if you can't make a living working there.
- Work with software teams to gather better data regarding where customers buy their machines. Unknown to most, Microsoft makes lots of money from Windows 10 as they display ads throughout the operating system. This goes for many of Microsoft's products. Just by using any computer with Windows, Microsoft makes money. These stats are NOT accounted for (and it's understandably complex), which does not give the store it's due credit in being an ambassador for Microsoft products. Basically I'm saying the current metrics being used are only a slice of the full picture and I believe the company is severely undervaluing it's retail employees. 
- Have better methods of evaluating employee competency. I went into the job with a fairly well-rounded IT skillset. Not once was I able to prove this skillset and present myself as a viable candidate for a role as a Service Advisor (Technician). There are so many talented workers being stifled by either lack of positions or lack of budget. This ties in with the next piece of advice:
- Hire based mostly on talent, knowledge, and ability to learn and grow. I've heard management say they will hire based on ""diverse"" characteristics before they hire based on skillset. It shows in the talent that was presented, especially the Service Advisor team. I think this comes from a lack of proper assessment tools before someone enters the role."

Like many other tech companies, there's a big emphasis on work-life balance and community building. In a lot of ways, it will feel like an extension of college in terms of the learning and events with other young professionals. Senior developers are, for the most part, very happy to mentor younger people and instill a sense of discipline. Internal mobility is fantastic as well, moving from team to team is relatively frictionless and it's Microsoft, so there's a team for almost any area you want to work in. There are so many resources that there's an expert for basically anything you want to know. There's tons of young professionals around too and Seattle is a great place to live. Pay is competitive with the other top companies at a junior level.

Exit opportunities are great here as well. If you pay attention and put effort into your work, you will come out with a brand name that recruiters all over want to see, as well as a disciplined, rigorous skill set to match.","As you move up in ranks, the pay disparity between Microsoft and its competitors (Google, Amazon, Facebook) starts to grow, with Microsoft developers making substantially less than their counterparts. For some, this is okay if they value lifestyle more than career progression. For others, it's common to jump ship to another company.

As with any other big company, there's layers and layers of bureaucracy. For most mature teams, all work will be carefully planned months in advance, specced, discussed in multiple team meetings, with dedicated PMs and testers. In the beginning this is good because it teaches the absolute best, gold standard way to develop large software. After a while, it can become very dull and repetitive though.

The annual review system, which invariably involves peer feedback and encourages backstabbing peers, can be maddening. Even after spending several years here, most people will find it's hard to break off of the railroaded promotion system and really shine as a superstar, just due to the seniority-based culture and siloed nature of the work (you don't have the expertise to move into a management role or more technical area that's already being done by someone more senior, but by never doing that role you'll never build expertise).

Also your experience is hugely, hugely team dependent. Local team culture matters way more than anything that happens at top management level. Two employees at two different teams can have drastically different lives. Maybe the things I list as pros are actually cons in your team, and vice versa. Unfortunately there's no real way to tell what it'll be like working on a team until you actually start working there. You can gauge the number of young vs old developers to get a sense of the culture though.

Despite this Microsoft is still a fantastic company, no regrets after having worked here for 6 years. The opportunity to work alongside world-class engineers to ship code that all modern versions of Windows use has been a privilege.",

- Easy Job
- Pays more than IBM
- Stress free in terms of physical labor
- Microsoft offers amazing benefits. My current benefit payout is 19.1k. 
- Microsoft pays you back for fitness related items
- Workplace environment is relaxed
- Great starter job in the IT industry, I would recommend this job to people just starting out.","These are the Cons for Microsoft Datacenter:

- Does not pay nearly as much as Amazon or Oracle 
- Job might be easy, but it's very linear. You will definitely need something to distract you from the boredom.
- Gossip and backstabbing is like wildfire in this particular location of Microsoft.
- Does not offer any holidays off at all, unless requested. And only 3 people per shift can get them off. Everyone else is stuck here on holidays. (upside you get double pay if working on holidays).
- People get hired here with subpar knowledge on how to do the work, which has caused a high turnover rate of talent. 
- Very little to almost no career opportunities in terms of promotions. Most people have to move out, in order to move up. This also sorta ties into the talent having a higher turnover rate.
- Yearly pay raise is extremely low.","This is the Advice to Management for Microsoft Datacenter:

- More interpersonal skills with the employees. We would rather want to see you as someone who's actually out there working with the employees, or at least trying to relate to us, rather than sitting in an office all day behind closed doors doing email work. We run a data center, not an office building. We ALL should know how to do the work, not just the few of us. 
- Please hire more talent, and less fillers. Perhaps consider replacing some deadwood to alleviate the discrepancy."

They have different cultures, and there's no end to interesting projects to work on.
You're encouraged to move around within the company to find a good fit--but you still have to go through a lengthy interview process with the new team each time.","Work/life balance seems to be slowly declining across the company. There are no QA teams anymore in most places (because quality is the devs' responsibility) but it's rare to find a team that is willing to allocate enough time to actually write sufficient tests. This makes it hard to write code at quality without just working extra hours.

Work flexibility is good if you are one of the mid-level management's favorite children. Some of my coworkers have ridiculous amount of vacation or out of office days.

Good benefits, the company takes care of its employees.

Opportunities to explore and employees are encouraged to move around inside the company although you must go through an interview process or a ""loop"". Given the size of the company, you will find a role truly excites you.

Nice and smart people to work with and to learn from.","Just want to claim that below is only witnessed in my org and not sure will be applicable to the whole company. But I'm sure certain patterns are the same across the board.

Politics or clique is a big issue at the company. The CEO is trying to change the company culture. However, you will find strong resistance to the change from many long-time employees. Some people managers are so fake and pretend to care about you. Instead, they will manipulate and twist messages to guard their jobs and step on your head for promotion. Backstabbing is common to benefit one's own career development. 

Conversations are not inclusive, and communication is bad. When you are unfairly treated, there is no place for your voice to be heard or for you to be understood. If you try to explain, you will be regarded as too defensive and not willing to embrace the growth mindset. When there's misunderstandings, basically my manager told me to shut up in a polite way. I also have been shut down multiple times by senior employees when I tried to help them understand things on a project.

Mid-level management don't know how to create clarity. They will use big and vague words to sound smart, but they cannot explain themselves when you ask follow up questions for details or clarification.

Talents have been leaving the team constantly and no one from management has any interest to investigate. Instead, they think that they are nurturing talents for the company. Some senior employees who stayed don't even know how to use our own technology.",

Looks really good on my resume now",Every other aspect that one could imagine. Please see advice to management.,"I worked at Microsoft this summer as an intern in Bellevue. I’m writing this with a friend who also worked at Microsoft. He didn’t find out his commute would be an hour an a half each way every day until the first day of work, and he did not have a car. One fun thing was during my summer, everyone moved floors, except for me and three other interns. So for 6 weeks of the summer, I was literally alone on the floor, without an office or any adults to talk to. It was as if they forgot we existed. My boss came into work maybe 10 times over the course of the summer. It was considered a “fun” and “different” day if he was there! I personally felt very underutilized, having little to no work to do every day. My friend also had a project that took him 4 weeks to complete (the internship is 12 weeks), and 3 of those weeks were spent trying to get people to respond to emails.

Fast forward to the school year after. I emailed my recruiter and my former boss telling them of my upcoming plans to not return due to this experience and wish to be literally anywhere else on this earth next summer. It was a nice email, well-intentioned. Neither of them responded to me. It baffles me that everyone at the company makes literally no effort to capture and retain talent. At a dinner I had with my recruiter, he literally said: “We just can’t compete with Facebook or Google” in regards to recruiting anyone. Maybe you could if you made any effort, like responding to my emails or making it seem like an interesting place to work, or giving me work when you are paying me.

But it was fun to be in Seattle! I met my current lover there. Also work had free drinks (but nothing else). If you are looking for a job where you have to do next to nothing and get paid lots for it (aren’t we all), Microsoft is the place for you! Personally, I have ambition."

Good benefits. Great matching on 401k and charitable contributions. Working with smart people. Saying you work for Microsoft.,"You truly have to enjoy politics to work here. This company is more about popularity than productivity. 

Hierarchical, deep rooted long term relationships and loyalties in teams make it hard for new employees to be successful.

If you think you are here for the exciting technology you are fooling yourself. You must love Powerpoint and Excel to work at Microsoft.  You will spend 90% of your time building and finding decks and spreadsheets unless you are in a developer type role.

Microsoft sales teams are only customer focused when it's renewal or sales time. After the renewal,  if it doesn't make them money they do not care.

Our customers use our technology more than we do. We are just beginning to fully implement Microsoft Teams almost a full year after our customers have struggled with it.  

Our internal systems are awful. Our vast IP is in so many places and so difficult to find you will spend days trying to find a Powerpoint Deck. Trying to find a internal resource is even more difficult. 

Partners still rule and the Services Group is the red headed step child of the organization. Avoid being employed on the Services side of Microsoft if you want a long term career.  Services will never hit their numbers and are considered to be a drain on the organization as a whole. 

The leadership is also lackluster and out of touch. They are so concerned with promoting women, due to a recent lawsuit, they are promoting incapable women in positions they are not qualified for. I am a woman and while I appreciate the change in Microsoft's position on hiring women, they belittle me when they hire women not because they are the best candidate but because the need to make their numbers. More women suffer under their poor leadership than succeed because of a hiring quota percentage.","My best advice is to start over. About 20% of the leadership is qualified and capable to lead and about 80% of your employees want another job inside or outside of Microsoft. You have a problem but because Microsoft makes so much money, essentially they are a cash printing machine, on licenses it will continue to be swept under the rug.  It's typically not until a company starts going downhill that they eliminate the layers of middle management and bureaucracy."

- Compensation and benefits are generous
- It's a family friendly company if you're at that stage in your life and want to slow down
- The company is financially stable ( for now )","- The ratio of PMs to engineers is ridiculous. There are only a handful of engineers for every PM in my org. Our backlog keeps growing, while the features with the best ""visibility"" and the least amount of investments gets resourced.

- Many of the PMs are non-technical. They've landed this job due to dumb luck, then wonder why the over-worked engineers can't get this done faster. When work items take longer than expected, IC PMs are pressed to ask them to ""work faster"".

- The more talented people at the company leave. Those who stay are the ones who can't get jobs with similar pay elsewhere. Those who stay and take on work with great ""visibility"" great promoted. This means that product planning tends to be short sited. Seniors only want to work on something they can get done before the next review period.

- It's getting more difficult to recruit. PMs are joining in increasing numbers from non-technical domains. They may have domain knowledge in the space, but they're not engineers. This is going to  exasperate the problems I mentioned above.

- Upper management is very disconnected from the reality of building software in the modern age. Most of them haven't touched code in decades, or have been around since the early days of the Internet. They think we are a first-class engineering company, yet we don't have real time metrics, continuous deployment, technical debt controls, testing...

- Not agile, despite at the rhetoric.

- We're so much on building a culture around everything except having a great software engineering team.","- Stop hiring unqualified people
- Promote new college hires - WITH TECHNICAL CHOPS - faster to management positions so the company can be saved before it's too late
- Understand what you're building before you start

Steady paycheck. Great medical benefits.,"- The amount of time spent in Powerpoint is egregious. STOP wasting so much time “telling the story” and build some freakin’ customer centric features.

- Program management is not product management.  They literally don’t have the modern product skill set. They have a project management/timeline based skill set and therefore, it needs to be handed over to UX immediately.

- Engineering has little accountability. Once a year, on every team, it becomes clear that engineering is taking their sweet time and using technical obfuscation (everyone else’s lack of tech stack knowledge) to buy more time.

- Engineering has WAY too much input on experiences which they have no expertise in. I can’t tell you how many devs I have had to “convince” to do the right thing for customers. I appreciate collaboration, but devs are in a role to help execute the strategies of UX and product management, they don’t need to have input into the strategy, just the tech efficiencies within it...because you aren’t qualified or empathetic enough to do so.

- Once you become a senior, suddenly just being great at your job is not good enough and in order to receive any small portion of your already peanut sized bonuses, you will be expected to go “above & beyond” your role and will be viewed as an under performer if you don’t. It’s insane that a 100k person company would expect anyone to stand-out. It is a waste of time, just reward people for doing their jobs well and leave people alone.","- Take product ownership out of the hands of program management OR begin product management training for everyone of them...because most of your PM’s are project managers, not product managers. They literally don’t have the modern product skill set, so they either need to be taught it or it needs to be handed over to UX.

- Engineers need to culturally be shifted to a support role. No more “blocking until they approve”, they are to execute on behalf of the customer & user experience strategy teams - with input on tech efficiencies, not “what engineering thinks customers want”."

I honestly loved working for both of them and knew that what I was contributing to was an inspiring vision and mission! The benefits at Microsoft are outstanding, the events are a blast and are a fantastic motivator throughout the year , the opportunities for growth and diversity in your job... some of the best I’ve ever seen. Microsoft also is in a serious growth phase so it’s an exciting time to be a part of the organization!","I’m still pretty shocked at my experience since day 1. I’ll try to leave emotion out of it and share the historical events that occurred to remain truthful and not exaggerate. When I first came in as an MBA here, I was brought into my dream finance role. 24 hours after joining, my manager went on paternity leave for about 8 weeks. I heard from him a couple of times in that timeframe and that was about it. I got started working on some onboarding projects and everything was more or less fine. My office was on the other side of the building so I didn’t get to sit next to my team for the first 7 months. My teammates never really came by to say hi so it was tough to build new relationships with them, having to walk over constantly to try to connect. After my manager returned, he only talked to me a handful of times. I’d say I sat in about 8 hours worth of 1-1’s over my whole year there. I never received a performance review or feedback on a single project. I never received a quarterly or year end performance review. I never heard that I did well, but was reassured that that wasn’t my manager’s style. He’s never really one to say “good job”. Not great management. I never felt like I was wanted in that role, and I heard from numerous people that I was placed in that role by a recruiter and was never actually placed in an open role and thus I wasn’t really wanted from day 1. 

Now for the part that I still am just in shock around. In my organization, I was the only white person. About 3 different times, in team meetings, jokes were made about how I wouldn’t understand something or couldn’t relate because I was white and not Asian/middle eastern. I just brushed it off and laughed, but felt like I experienced a form of racism that I had never felt before. Having not felt like part of the team ever and then had them make jokes about my race at my expense... it really didn’t feel good. But, because I’m Caucasian and not something else, if never felt like I could say anything about it because it’s Seattle and many people believe racism against Caucasian people isn’t possible. I would disagree based on my experience.  

At the end of my time, after declaring I was leaving, I never heard from a single HR rep. I had so much I needed to share and I didn’t even get an email about my departure.  Nothing. Zero. No form of exit interview. No goodbye. Nothing. So now I’m sharing this all here because I didn’t get to share it internally. It was the strangest exit I’ve ever had. 

The moral is: people leave managers, not companies. Microsoft is a spectacular company, but my management experience was really, really poor and HR really dropped the ball here. I was so sad too having come into my dream job and feeling unwanted completely from day 1. I would’ve stayed if even one person showed that they cared in the least. I had shared this with multiple friends there on my last day who had been there for years and they were in utter disgust and shocked that HR had never reached out. They reached out on my behalf and even that didn’t trigger a response. 

I’m just really shocked and sad. I was really excited to build a career at Microsoft and chose to leave due to this experience.","Focus on training your managers to be true managers, builders and shapers of people. Make sure your people are heard."

Working for them cured that fondness, completely. The company is made up mostly of two kinds of people. Those that have been there forever and are expert at dodging responsibility and those that get used by those people. If you are a white male, run the other way as fast as you can. Microsoft is actively trying to 'cleanse' the company of white males. If you are not a white male you are 'diversity hire'... and they have goals to dramatically increase those. They wont say they are hoping to get rid of white males, but it's an inverse of myopically focusing on retaining everyone else. I've never met a more dishonest culture inside a company. The place is rife with two faced fake people. Sure there are some good people. But overwhelmingly the leadership is very veiled and sneaky. Prone to making abrupt and ill-informed decisions; which they can ultimately hide from the repercussions of or skillfully blame it on others. 
They seem to churn & burn a lot of people. This is probably a result of their bigger initiative to get rid of white men. But they also go out of their way to hire people that come from different backgrounds and then they try to pound them into being like everyone else at Microsoft. They literally sought me out for help, then told me how to do things. It's no wonder why Amazon is so much better at doing things than they are. They clamor to listen to Satya, which is ironic that his reports and ultimately the way the company runs is nothing like anything he says. Such as ""Microsoft runs on trust."" <-- this is perhaps the biggest joke them all.

If you don't live in WA state or nearby one of Microsoft's campuses, career advancement  is very tough unless you want to stay in a sales-oriented or 90%-travel position.   

Difficult and Time Consuming to Move Around in the Company:
The internal interview process to move into a new role or organization within the company is very slow (can take weeks or months), not at all transparent, and is a full-day interview experience just as external candidates have to face.  Competition is fierce but if you're persistent it's possible to land a new position.

Tools & Processes:
Employees continually have low marks on yearly polling regarding having the right tools, reports, and processes in place to get our jobs done effectively.  I haven't seen many improvements in the several years I've been here and don't expect many changes in the future either.

Compensation:
While the benefits are fantastic, the total compensation could be much better.  I feel that salaries and stock rewards are falling behind compared to other top tier tech companies.",Perhaps consider remote workers as a diversity classification or category that you strongly suggest Redmond-based managers to consider when hiring.  So many talented people cannot move to WA and find themselves frustrated at the lack of opportunities available in their own state.  Keep up the great work in changing the company's culture - love the employee engagement and benefits initiatives.

In the last few  years, the excitement was brought back by the new management. The new direction is clearer, more in line with  the industry needs.
There are frustrations there like anywhere else, but I always got the feeling that if you put some  effort into it, you could have a great career. And the different teams offer different cultures, so you can move around inside the company and  really keep the excitement going.
The people you work with are brilliant for the most part, and that is  definitely something I'll miss. Other companies have brilliant people too, I'm just saying that  most people at Microsoft I interacted with were really smart and it was great.
Most projects I worked on in Windows were really exciting, and touched the lives of millions of users. That's not something you get in all companies for sure.
Work-life balance is really good. I would say you  can control it: more hours will get you a better career, and that makes sense. Fewer hours  means less progression, but as long as you're doing a good job and meeting your  goals, you'll be  fine.
The use of telemetry and user feedback is getting really common and really helps deliver products that satisfy our customers.","Sometimes heavy infrastructure and processes, even though with the  shorter release cycles  have helped a lot with agility.
Sometimes, new V1 products do not feel like they're up to par with the legacy products they are replacing, then the V2 version often gets cancelled, so it sometimes feel like we are going slightly backwards in terms of functionality. Again, this seems to get better with the use of telemetry as we tend to focus on functionality that is most useful to customers.","Keep doing the transition work for more agile development and customer-centric features. I like the new direction the company is going. Keep bringing exciting components, and revive the innovation to compete with Google and others."

In reality, there is generally nothing egregiously wrong with the employee’s performance. It is just that the employee happens to have fallen into the path of the manager’s short-term measure of success and so will be chewed up and spit out.

Most PFE's are permanently stuck in the role. The only real option for most PFE's is to leave the company and secure new roles elsewhere and then possibly return to Microsoft later.,"Stop protecting ""friends"" of managers and get rid of dead weight.

-Too many people trying to feed off of you than co-operate with you or help you
-Few opportunities to do anything that would be useful outside of Microsoft
-Toxic culture of favoritism and bootlicking","Please don't be so much in love with your old-time jerks. I worked for 2 teams at Microsoft. The management wasted time for months. They gave us no direction while they were ironing out nitty gritty details they were going to change anyway several times over. I spoke to HR as well. It seems some old problems were common knowledge and routine frustration for all. Any kind of change took months or years to happen till it wasn't relevant anymore and did not help the people suffering the most. I learned you made some long sought changes after I left. These things were pain points for years. What's the point if it doesn't benefit the people who needed it?  You have anonymous feedback forms only if those people actually seek your feedback. There was no way to give anonymous feedback about people who worked with you and need not seek it. You make it too easy to game your system. The attitude of my co-workers was to first point the blame and then do nothing to prevent bugs in the future. I've rarely hear anyone say ""I'm sorry. My bad"" no matter how many times they screw up. If you disagree with some of them ever, get prepared to be shot down at every meeting. Also, if you don't want to co-operate with an employee, lay them off and save yourself and the employee some dignity. It becomes a little obvious if the day after I don't go to a morale event, my manager starts giving me low priority work and being critical of everything. It is too petty for a big organization like Microsoft to not just lay someone off than make it difficult to stay and difficult to look for another job. Utterly disappointed!"

Do not be fooled that just because this is Microsoft that you are doing huge things. At the end of the day it is just another retail job. My over arching problem with the job leads to the hours. You are expected to work minimum 20 hours a week which is normal but, when you submit an availability and your managers do not adhere to it, then it becomes a problem. Being a student, time management becomes tougher especially since work is not the main priority. Also, Even when voicing my concern, it does not seem like it is being heard and the managers do not pay much heed to new hires.  I do not understand why part timers can only have 5 hour shifts and are required to work 4 days when it is completely possible to work less days and longer hours especially if those days happen to be the busy days for the store. I write this review in hopes for management to read this and hopefully address my concern. Also another con is that it is fairly high stress. You deal with a plethora of customers and the word ""no"" is never and option. You have to treat customers far above many different places and it's outstanding the lengths one is required to go. I understand that the customer comes first, but the way it is being approached is utterly wrong. To each their own and this is my opinion. There are other things as well but I believe that this is enough.

You have to be really adept at knowing which group to be in. It's like a giant game of whack a mole, you can get hit at any time for no reason regardless of how good your performance is.  
I personally know someone who won Platinum Club (highest sales honor) and less than 2 months later was RIFed. There is ZERO consideration of the individual or talent when it comes to a RIF.  While they do allow you to interview back in, it's sort of an empty welcome as you are booted out of the company and treated like a new hire, at least from an access and interview perspective. Also you are only given 2 months...not nearly enough time given the glacial speed with which MSFT recruiting teams move. I've been on both sides of this now. I've interviewed and hired in dozens of great people at MSFT but the process is painful in my opinion.","I get that Microsoft needs to restructure, but you are doing an awful job at it right now. All your top performers if they aren't looking for new jobs are definitely looking over their shoulder or are left in an awful position as their vteams are getting RIFed and nobody is explaining why, or how they are going to get the resources to support their goals.  MSFT is a very collaborative place and when you suddenly lose 1/4 of your vteam that leaves the remaining employees with the same lofty goals and 1/4 less people to get it done. Even the managers are beside themselves and can't explain what's going on or how they are going to support the teams with the resources they have. 
While I agree with the big picture of the restructuring, leadership has to know and understand that they are releasing some of their most talented people into the market for their competition to scoop up. It feels very much like a person who has no knowledge of Microsoft business or a group of lawyers trying to keep MSFT out of harms way is making the RIF decisions.  There is a massive amount of tribal knowledge going out the door. Some of the RIFs eliminated whole teams of people who were the only ones with a key skillset (a skill noted by our CEO on stage as important). My manager was beside himself when I was RIFed, he's like you are the only one on our team who knew how to do this. I'm like sorry man, and by the way, everyone else I knew in MSFT who was good at what I do was RIFed as well, so you are going to be left with the blind leading the blind. good luck.  This may sound like a vindictive rant, but I've spoken off the record with extremely senior Partner level Engineering execs in Microsoft who don't understand some of the RIF decisions and are challenging some of the decisions made. For me, too late but hopefully they can stop the bleeding. 
Also on my CEO performance, my rating is based on what he's done for the stock, which is largely due to headcount reductions IMO."

Most employees are eager to help others when asked and also have a ton of knowledge to share.
Reviews are leaner with the Connect process.  If you are lucky enough to have a good people manager, you should look to have a Connect every 2-3 months, which is great for helping to keep you on track and give you more accurate measurements of impact.
Azure is taking off and the focus is moving entirely to an engineering/developer mindset, leveraging Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).  The more you deliver that has direct impact the more you will be rewarded.","The Ying to the Yang is that while Connects are good, they are also limited to the discretion of the manager.  You will likely get at least 2 Connects a year based on organizational pressure to management; however, in some cases that is not always the case.  Even if you can represent significant impact in Connects, you are again at the discretion of the manager.  You manager can completely disagree and provide negative feedback and there is not much you can do about it other than to move internally to another team or organization to avoid a bad situation.

The Switch from no out-of-pocket health care to a high deductible plan with an HSA was tough, but I personally understand that the former wasn't sustainable. Note that Microsoft feeds the account and for a healthy family with not much more than regular maintenance health services, you can spend less than the company's contribution. This means the savings will grow and be available in retirement years.","The usual baggage that comes from a long-established company, like overuse of internal tools instead of industry standard tools, as well as entrenched processes and bureaucracies that can hinder agility and efficiency.

Competing against others who don't maintain a balance between work and life can leave you on the outside, and that's not uncommon here. Working hard and long hours can get you rewarded with opportunities and promotions, and it's hard to argue against this (if you're doing the work, I guess you should get rewarded). It's just demoralizing when choosing not to de-prioritize family can work against your upward trajectory.","Keep pushing toward modern practices and tools. Find ways to remain current in developer technologies and methodologies and ensure it is easy for developers to find time to advance their skills. If developers feel they are lagging behind the field, they may leave to avoid becoming irrelevant or obsolete (or unhireable).

If your portfolio is your greatest asset, this is moot, but if you agree that your people/talent are your greatest asset, liberate managers from the burden of having to ""deliver or else"" (or more softly stated, the high pressure to meet the bottom line at the expense of some flexibility for the employees)  and allow them to keep talent (their employees) thriving.

You're ""making an impact"" if you manage to actually do something that will improve customers' experiences or make other engineers actually more productive rather than waste more of their time.  FYI, at most companies I've worked with, ""Impact"" is the standard and a lack of impact results in termination of the employee, team, or the entire company itself.

Microsoft under Satya Nadella is paying lip service to the philosophy that made Microsoft great in the first place and has been serving other companies so well recently, but in practice the company is a bloated, ineffectual behemoth of failure.  Most of the people who brought the tech industry to its knees in the 80s and 90s got rich and got out, and they trained a generation of quiet, useless busybodies to replace themselves.  Anyone with any passion or dedication to quality got slowly extruded out the back end of the company over the last 20 years, until we got to this point where Microsoft abandons+reboots their failed phone platform every two years and makes laughably terrible moves like removing the Start Button and forcing updates on people mid-presentation.","It's easy to QQ anonymously online, but I'm not sure what I could do to eliminate all this worthless dead weight if I were the CEO.

Always a top company.  Good pay and benefits.  And with so many products and regional operating centers, there is a lot of opportunity to structure a career however you want.  

Schedules are pretty flexible, but there is an unspoken rule/expectation to 'be online' to make up any time taken.  Work life balance is a Microsoft value.  And for the most part there is no problems taking time when you need it.  Plus there is a work from home availability.","There is too much management and it is top down management.  It is a constant energy suck to prove your value, why you are necessary to your job.  The need to do your day job at night is constant.  There are so many meetings and so much political games that morale is low.  If you are not a buddy with LT, you get a lot of crap thrown over the fence to you and I constantly fight to maintain my job ownership.   

People get promoted for very little (even being gone on parental leave for 6 months of the year!) and folks get promised a promo and don't get one.  And I cannot say enough to paint the appropriate picture of the review process here.  It is abysmal.  It takes hours to write and usually happens after your rewards for the year is already set.  And your rewards are not based on what you accomplished.  It is people's perspective of the value.  I have had a manager tell me I have not delivered anything in a year because my skip level doesn't see anything I deliver and isn't aware of its impact.  Yet my job is to keep things running smoothly so they don't receive any escalations.  Again, it isn't what you do in your job, it is what you did in addition to your job and how loud you showcase it.

While there are opportunities here, it is extremely time consuming to transition somewhere else.  If, stress the IF, you get an informational to discuss the job opening, it is even rarer that you get selected for the interview loop.  There is a common saying here, it is easier to leave Microsoft and come back then it is to transfer internally. 

While it is also a Pro, the benefits at MS are not what they used to be.  Pay is similar now to lots of companies.  And a lot of the pay is rolled up in your annual review, which includes a bonus and stock.  the bonus is below average and the stock only vests 1/5 a year.  So while your stock is part of your 'raise' you don't get any until 6 months to a year later.  And if you leave MS, you lose it.  So it is really a Con.  Healthcare is good but no longer free.  Employees have to pay out of pocket now based on HSAs and are taxed on employer paid portions.  It is viewed as a cost containment not a benefit anymore.    I hear from old colleagues they get better pay and benefits when leaving MS.  They felt undervalued here and when they leave they receive large bumps in pay and equivalent levels.

Overall, lots of companies compare with MS now whereas MS used to distinguish themselves with better than anyone benefits.","Practice what you preach, what Satya preaches, what MS supposedly stands for.  Appreciate your employees and invest in what they do/who they are."

The technology is amazing if you are passionate about seeing the future, this is a great place to do it. Satya is a good leader who is genuinely trying to change the company for the better.","Its a big ship that takes a long time to turn, so many of the old mindsets are still highly prevalent in the organization.  The key ones are:
1) Arrogance: Yes, there are bright people here, but sadly people tend to believe their own press too much. 
2) Lack of customer centricity:  Linked to #1, people believe they know more than customer do. Frankly, customer is a concept on a ppt slide. Part of the problem is that all global roles are a) based in Redmond b) rarely leave Redmond c) not directly linked to the field where the work actually happens d) spend their time building playbooks and strategy videos NO ONE actually reads or cares about. 
3) Linking words with action: the follow-through is non-existent. You sit in a meeting and the person will say, I will drive that and come back. They rarely do. Its such a large company and globally you are disconnected from the business in many groups so the accountability is not there.
4) Leadership gaps: Leaders tend to be very isolated, at the CVP and GM levels, you engage them through their business managers who filter information to them.   Most leaders also are more focused on making partner than developing their teams, sadly. 
5) You have to be in the Enterprise side, the consumer side is a trainwreck, led by people who have no clue what they are doing. Its also not a focus (outside of Office) for Satya. If you are a strong retail person, you will quickly see many serious challenges. 

Satya is driving change and its the right change, but the challenge is that while he has replaced many of the Senior Leaders who didn't buy into his game plan, the next level of management (GM) is still firmly entrenched in the ways of the past so will take a long time to make Microsoft a customer-centric, people-focused, agile organization and by that time, the market will have already moved on.","Move from box checking to real accountability that starts with a genuine consideration for the customer, who you have neglected for a long time.  Embrace a direction, either in or out of the consumer business, devices or just become an enterprise services company.  If we were a person, we would be committed for our erratic behavior."

Basically, hiring teams don't really get to see you in order to evaluate your qualification unless they have a req for a college hire. This means that you as a candidate have less opportunities since you are pushed into a smaller set of job-opening (and auto-rejected from industry-hire category), and you as a hiring team are being excluded from considering candidates that are technically qualified.

This seems insane, policy trumps qualification! 

It was like this when I joined back the end of the last century! Crazy that such an irrational policy is still the HR mantra.

Not quite up to par as far as smaller, scrappy companies. Too many PMs running around trying to ""add value"" while a lot just scrape by doing the minimum. It's easy to step on toes if you want to make an impact, and it's annoying to watch others just coasting and getting the same salary.
Similar to the PM group, Dev and QA folks can be really hit or miss.
Accountability is something that seems to be lacking. KPIs are rarely tracked after a product ships, and any mishaps are just hushed.
Benefits like free lunches, booze, and good coffee are not found here. I really don't know why, since it wouldn't cost the company much and would significantly improve the culture and retention, but Microsoft seems to be stubborn in this regard.","Cut down the number of PMs in the Windows group. There are seriously way too many, which means each PM is only reaching a fraction of their productivity.
Hold all disciplines accountable for the features and code they ship. Actually look at KPIs for PMs, and track bugs for the Engineering team. If people jump teams, make sure accountability follows them."

- A lot of turnover in the leadership ranks of the company as well as recruiting organization. Lose one or two here and there and that's the cost of doing business, but lose handfuls of high level people within a few months time and there is something else going on entirely. My experience was the latter.
- Innovation is at the core of Satya's principles and is on just about every powerpoint deck, the problem is though, with hundreds of thousands of employees it'll probably take 10 years for meaningful change in the way business is done has been solidified across the company. He took over in 2014, the bad old habits of sitting on the cash pile still plague innovation in 2017. This isn't an indication of bad leadership by Satya, he is great, but there needs to be more strategic changing of the guard in key areas across the company to speed up the process to remain competitive and breed thought leadership.
- So much of what managers are brought in to do is handcuffed by the Director level employees (at least in recruiting) that ideas from those closer to the work rarely are considered or even heard. Essentially, the political game of who can speak loudest to be seen is still very much in play, rather than getting the most from those they hire.","From one manager to those in management...I joined Microsoft because of Satya's vision and the thought that recruiting had finally turned a corner from the stereotype of old Microsoft ways. In a lot of ways, the corner has been turned but far too sharply and now you have an organization far too centralized that scale isn't an option, innovation is by consensus and the perpetual decades old issue of resourcing teams with far too heavy a vendor population against ever reducing budgets. 

My advice to management from someone who was in a management role but never really allowed to lead is to unleash you managers to do great work. If you hire them, let them showcase their skill set, which includes owning team budgets, hiring how they see fit, building strategy, building their own recruiting eco system...essentially create a builder/innovation management team, don't just talk about it. Most of all, do not separate sourcing and recruiting, the amount of friction between functions that are part of the same overall function is toxic. Lastly, because one's title isn't a Director or higher does not mean that they don't aspire to be at that level or can't do a ton of great work, you just have to truly let them without the politics in play. People join companies, they leave managers. Don't be managers, be leaders and invest time in your teams and the rest will take care of itself."

There have been more than a few layoffs (wrapped into ""re-orgs"") in recent years and the practice of stack ranking employees has continued, although mgmt attempted to obscure this by calling it something else (b/c of the negative press following the Vanity Fair article about 5yrs ago).  

For years now it seems that numbers have been set at unattainable levels so that most don't make their numbers. This started during the K.T. era (former COO), presumably to cut payout costs, but it has continued after his departure. If I recall, it started after the company announced an across the board raise in base salaries (apparently in response to 'employee feedback about too much compensation being tied to stock'). 

From that point growth targets seemed to get crazy and a lot of good people left. You'd have one good year but 2 bad ones. Mgmt might change quota or revenue recognition rules mid year and there's nothing you can do about it; or worse yet, you may not find out there was a rule change until the end of the fiscal when you're trying to figure out why your attainment number is off. Incentive plans are so complex that you need a PhD to comprehend. Reporting tools are often broken and you may not be able to accurately track progress against goal, so you may get screwed if you have a manager with few scruples or if you have a mgr looking for a sacrificial lamb for the bottom of the stack ranking.","1. Put in an end to the unrealistic numbers. You'll have a better shot at retaining top talent.  2. Provide a reporting system that works.  3. Reduce the number of re-orgs.  4. Truly bring an end to stack ranking. Don't just call it something else.

Satya can say all he wants that he's turning the place around and invests in people - but it's not entirely true. You have the same VPs running teams there and they continue to perpetuate favoritism and sexism. There is no safety at Microsoft. You may be okay in a role for a while, until there is a re-org. A new VP comes in and replaces all the leadership with people they know. That job you were waiting around for? Gone. It's given to someone the VP trusts.

Culture is also about how we treat each other. Office politics happen when there is a lack of trust in the workplace. Teams are still competing with the each other for resources. Within teams, managers are playing games to protect their own feature areas and resources. With respect to compensation, it gets worse. While MSFT can say they got rid of the stack rank, it's the same budget for rewards. It's not possible to give everyone a max payout with the budget. This means the VP takes from everyone to give top rewards to a few key performers.

2) If you ever join MSFT, good luck finding your next job. Many recruiters will question your ability to get anything done. There is definitely prejudice against MSFT employees in the valley.","- To really get rid of the stack rank, every team should be given an annual rewards budget which would allow VPs to grant a max payout for everyone.

Made lots of friends and connections. 
A wealth of technologies and roles can be yours!
Depending on the group: a good work-life balance.
The company itself appears to be on a good trajectory!","This may sound like ""sour grapes"" due to recently being laid off by them, but here goes. (Note, most of this has to do with the last group I was in. I hope many others find this NOT to be true.)

* No loyalty: After 10+ years, I came in one day and was let go with FIVE days to find a new job internally. HR doesn't even move that fast! It wasn't performance-based (it came as a surprise to my manager, too) and via the black box that is HR I can only speculate why I was let go: politics? ageism? racism? I was too short? randomly? etc...

* Management in some orgs view devs as indistinct work units. ""For project X I need Y people."" Talent, experience, etc. doesn't matter as much anymore; just someone with a pulse that's breathing and knows C#.

* Politics. Sure, most places have it, but my last position was the first time I've seen retributive actions taken by senior management to get rid of less-than-supportive team members (not me).

* Cronyism: I've seen my teammates not get funding for plane travel from his hometown to campus (Redmond) once every 3-6 months and thus traveled via bus. Meanwhile friends of senior management fly home weekly to California. Friends and the ""good ol' boys"" are more important than the business or fairness. Even while I was getting laid off, certain ""good ol' boys"" were still hiring their friends from outside Microsoft.

* Sexism: Our group's leadership were entirely comprised of Indian males. Unfortunately India has a prevalent sexist culture in many places, and this was transferred to our group. I have Indian friends (male and female) who agree with me, so please don't accuse me of being racist. The women in our group were frequently marginalized and one quit after being told to ""shut up and be quiet"" during a meeting. Not wishing to cause waves none of them wanted the bother and hassle of reporting it to HR so they just left.

* Lack of support for remote folks. It's the 21st Century and some entire orgs have a ""no remote"" policy.","Please protect women. Give them a safe (anonymous?) space to report things. The ones I spoke to knew that our HR contact was good friends with our senior management and complaints (of which there were some) went nowhere.

And staff is two faced. They tell you to go to them if you need help, when they secretly report to managers about anything and everything you do. Do not trust anyone here.

Asinine writeups for things they do countless times, such as a manager daily would drop the F bomb multiple times a day and say other bad words as well, when we get written up for an accidental slip up swear.

Manager asked me if she wasn't putting out after I had a conversation with my female friend. If I said this about their husband or wife, I'd be fired instantly. 

Manager would constantly harass me for asking questions when first starting employment, then get angry that I asked questions, just wanted to make sure I did my job correct. (I have aspergers) 

When I confronted the manager who harassed me I was told I'm not thinking growth mindset and It's my job.... it's my job to be harassed because I asked questions? Terrible.

I have two jobs. Working 6 am and Microsoft all the way till 10 pm. They would hold me later at night because they wouldn't have their stuff together and would make people go on overtime when they aren't even suppose to. Very unorganized. So I get 5 hours of sleep because they fail at their jobs? 

Manager also would complain I wasn't following the steps of service... which I did by the book, got a 10/10 review as well as a full attachment item. And they still complain, never would they try and give positive feedback.

When I asked about the feedback problem why they are always negative, they say I can't take constructive criticism. It's always negative, even if you do things right. 

Over 70% of the employees there hate it, and are only there because of the company benifits. Most are looking for a new job.

Manager would make non racial problems into racial problems because of insecurities. 

I was discriminated agaisnt, and even told them of my aspergers before applying to the job. 

One thing that really blows my mind.. they tell you to enforce a no chair policy when sitting near xbox section. When I enforced this policy, the customer was unhappy about it and I was written up for ""talking bad against the customer"" When I never said any word to him. All I did was ask a manager if they needed to be moved to confirm what they told me before. 

This place is a joke, the turnover and employees is a joke, they leave and get fired because this place is run by jokes.

2. Review System is extremely horrible because stack ranking still happens as of 2016. Though they don't communicate to employees, but HR and Manager maintains Stack ranking and probably curve too. Stack ranking is so horrible that manager who has great sales power takes advantage of situation and manager who are technical but not good in sale looses their employee being rated down. So it is extremely important to report to best manager who is best of his manager, if you want to succeed in Microsoft.","Fire all First and Second Level managers.

Ever since Microsoft got rid of their competitive review, stack-ranking system, a few years ago, it has really improved morale and productivity in my opinion. Instead of focusing how to outshine your peers, the focus is now on a growth mindset and how you leverage other's ideas to help you do a better job. It's about partnership and collaboration.  

Microsoft does preach work-life balance. I think many have achieved a good balance while others struggled.  The key to a good balance is the organizational VP has to buy-in to the concept.","Some people seem overworked and it is usually attributed to their functional organization's leader that doesn't understand how convey the importance of balance.

You will work with incredibly smart people","Reluctance to truly embrace open source tools for development really hurts developer skill sets. For example, instead of moving to tools like Spark, MSFT builds it's own tools. Most of their own internal development doesn't even use products they sell externally, like Azure. The proprietary tools they use will severely hurt you when you are looking for your next job.

The company is huge part 1. The scope of what you will work on will most likely be small features on existing products. This might be OK from a pure C++ coding perspective but it won't allow you to get architecture development experience, learn new tools or if you want to do something innovative with new technologies. 

The company is huge part 2. It's difficult to stand out when there are hundreds of really good engineers in a division. There are few engineering management roles now, most were eliminated.

Culture can be somewhat forced. Small companies usually have a better culture.

Office has implemented a ""Shared Engineering"" model. Software Engineers are supposed to write product code, test and develop the resulting data streams. Realistically you will find few people that can or want to do all three well.","Management has done a fairly good job at moving development to become more agile over the last few years.

* Microsoft is quietly getting rid of its older workers. With each layoff, even those that are supposedly to ""fix"" the phone division debacle, older workers in other divisions are also laid off. They are often rehired later as a contractor at a substantially reduced rate.

* Management in my division made it very clear that any new hiring or replacements for those who quit would  not be in the US. There is talent in this country, but Microsoft isn't willing to pay for it.

* Because of the internal politics and processes, any real innovation happens due to acquisitions and mergers.

-Pretty stable job, if you're in the right org
-Work with a lot of really smart people
-Maker garages on campus for prototyping
-A lot of potential to move around in the company","-Over the last 10 years, it went from more personal feeling to completely robotic, and now something slightly less robotic.  You feel very replaceable.  
-Satya's new culture and values sound great, but feel like they haven't made much inroads in the company.  Ex. We have hackathons now, where we're supposed to get a week off to work on something cool.  Unfortunately, schedules don't account for this, so if you do the hackathon, you still have to meet your deadlines anyway.  Since they already fill you to the brim with work, it's not a real plausible activity.
-Agile, but not really agile.  There's a new agile movement going through the company, which is great!  Unfortunately, leadership seems to still be operating in waterfall mode, so bottoms up planning still needs to be done.
-Not invented here syndrome is really hurting the company's productivity.  Teams are so tied to homegrown mechanisms for shipping it takes forever.  Open source is making inroads, but there will continue to be friction so long as people's reviews are tied to value delivered, and value delivered is usually measured by working software.
-Seattle area housing market is insane.  Most decent homes within a reasonable commuting distance start at $650k+; at current mortgage rates, you need 20% down minimum ($130k in cash), and many home sales come down to bidding wars with buyers paying all in cash or $100k over asking.","If you want to attract and retain world-class talent, reward your people what they're worth.  There's something broken with a review model that penalizes you for being average on a high-performing team (implying that everyone is adding more value than average), but rewards you if you are a rockstar on an average team, or if you're a perpetual fire-fighter.  This creates the situation where it's in the best fiduciary interest of the individual to find troubled teams to improve and be a rockstar in, rather than find a highly functioning team and grow with them.

1. This particular work group lacks absent of any of the published Microsoft company values. 
2. Complete and total lack of honesty by nearly every people manager in the group. Very few are trustworthy.
3. Unethical hiring practices - hiring managers are encouraged to avoid hiring women and Caucasian men.
4. Engineers and Project Managers are specifically asked to hide product lapses from the public and customers especially around security and other gaps which might slow sales in any way. 
5. While publically stating that the customer is first - behind the scenes the directors and other senior managers spend countless hours determining how to conceal defects versus fixing them.
6. Product planning in this area of the company is conducted by the equivalent of 5th graders who have absolutely no idea how to run planning exercises which results in complete and total chaos during development. Efforts are often uncoordinated and result in both Engineering and Project Management teams fighting for scarce resources resulting in incomplete features or skipping quality and security controls.","Overall  - this is a miserable group to work in.

It was a lot of shady things occurring in our store and favoritism was a huge issue as well. People were not held accountable for their mistakes or lack of work unless management didn't like you. After constantly complaining and filing lawsuits against the store manager, most of the management has been replaced but it personally left a bad taste in my mouth for Microsoft.","Not quite sure how much corporate values the retail side of Microsoft, but I would continue to keep a close eye on the stores primarily in Atlanta.

* You have to be very careful with management and with peers, if you talk too much about what is not going well and how to change it you may be seen as too negative and that you can never overcome even if you are sincere in your intentions of making things better and offer suggestions on how to change
* Values external candidates rather than internal ones
* Slow to respond to new technologies or opportunities","I don't believe the level of management that could enable change will be reading this right now.  Perhaps recruiting will so they can learn what impressions external candidates will have when they go through the interview loop.  I have been at Microsoft through the Gates and Ballmer years and now since Satya's start.  During the Ballmer years Microsoft was always late to respond to disruptive technologies like the internet, virtualization and mobile phones to name a few.  I believe Microsoft and its shareholders are much better off with the direction Satya is taking the company.  At this point though Microsoft is so big and has its hands in so many different things - Azure, Office 365, gaming, etc that its hard for Microsoft to respond quickly to opportunities.  This slowness is fueled by the politics of the organization getting in the way of making any change quickly.  One final thought, over the years I've had an average of a new manager every 18 months.  Out of all of these I can think of only 3 that were true people managers.  They made it their job to guide you, advise you, and help you get to where you are going in your career.  Most everyone else I've come across was in the management position for what felt like power.

A lot of people say the teams in Microsoft can be drastically different with some teams having a harsh environment while others a much more friendly one. Well, my experience working on different teams was pretty similar, and I can say the same for some of my teammates that worked on different teams as well. 

Some of the pros are:
Fair base salary, large company with lots of opportunities, some smart engineers, good benefits (vacation, parental leave, health care, etc).","When it comes to working environment, Microsoft has evolved a lot in the last couple of years. The evolution was triggered mostly by getting rid of the draconian stack ranking review system where even great engineers could get poor reviews. However, there`s still much to improve before I could say Microsoft has a friendly and truly cooperative environment and a meritocracy based rewards system.

There`s still a lot of politics where the people who rub the managers back the most are the first being rewarded; most engineers there are not really interested in helping each other; rewards are  not based on results and talent, but on politics and the number of years they have been working there.

When it comes to work life balance, some managers push people to work very hard, but when they do so and achieve great results, there`s little to no recognition for that. In some managers mind, working 12-14 hours a day is just expected; other managers might not push you too hard, but don`t expect any recognition from them as well. To be fair, it`s fairly quick to get promotions from lower levels, but from mid to higher levels (62 and up), it becomes very difficult: just results and talent is not enough, politics is required.

When it comes to compensation, the base salary is fair / aligned with the industry, but stocks and bonuses are well below similarly recognized companies, so compensation altogether is 50-150k below companies like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and even Amazon.","Foster truly cooperation between team mates instead of focusing on just getting things done ASAP; recognize people based on results and not on politics; if you do push people to work very hard, recognize and reward them when they do so."

Not much support by management to explore areas of interest in terms of new tools or technologies. This might have been a culture trait of my team.

Lots of redundant menial work that should be automated, but no bandwidth given to work on tools for these. Also a lot of the existing tools were slow or error prone and needed to be improved or redone, but again no bandwidth given for these.

Benefits are pretty decent, with the exception of the medical plan, which is a high-deductible HSA type deal. There are small pockets within the company which are still pretty good.","The company is dying. People are disenchanted, unimaginative, and in general just don't care. A lot of things are ""the way they've always been"". Way too much people who have been there for 15-20 years and don't know any better. Terrible fragmentation between teams makes collaboration next to impossible. Unnecessarily rigid scheduling leads to sandbagging and hampers quality. Way too many PMs. People aren't interested in helping you _at all_, moreover, come review time it is not uncommon for backstabbing to break out. HR pretending that rather obvious cost cutting measures are ""better for the employees"". Heavy weight top-down culture. If you like to work with minimal interference, this is not the company where you will be able to do so.","Get rid of people who have been at Microsoft for 20+ years, or at least limit their influence. Hire more people from modern companies (Google, FB, Amazon). They're available, albeit very expensive. Thoroughly modernize development. Abolish rigid schedules for projects where they are not necessary (which is most of them, if you stop pre-announcing). Force the entire company to use the same bugtracker, distributed build/testing infrastructure, deployment tools, source control, etc. Really make those initiatives a priority, fund them, and staff them with good talent (bonus points for releasing this infra on Azure as a service). All code and all bug trackers MUST be open to ALL FTEs, not just to see, but also to work on if they encounter a problem. Lay down the law to encourage cross-project contributions. Most data should be available and easily queryable by any FTE. Basically just methodically go and destroy every single obstacle to cross group collaboration, be they technical or political. Fire people (especially managers, since engineers tend to be quite open to collaboration) when they sabotage this. Get rid of 80% of PMs. One PM per several smaller teams is just fine. Methodically identify and cull deadwood. Institute one company coding standard for each language so that all code uses the same conventions and can be leveraged instead of having to rewrite it. Start dumping Windows in Azure, except for things that really require it. Fully embrace Linux, and use it for all new Azure services. Desktop will continue to be dominated by Linux, but on the server, Linux just runs circles around Windows these days, both in terms of how suitable it is, and in terms of the enormously valuable ecosystem of software that the world has built (and continues to build) for it.

Desktop Windows is dying, mobile Windows is a lost cause, and can't coast on multibillion-dollar Office revenues forever. If Microsoft is to survive in the long term, you're going to have to change the company culture, even though that's painful to do."

Quit saying impact without defining it concretely, communicating exactly what that means to you, and how it can be quantified.

They have a massive poll once a year and they really seem to listen to our responses
When you have a good manager, you are set up to do well and advance in pay/responsibilities","Management is a toss-up. In my 5 years with MS I've had 9 managers. 1 was excellent, 2 were decent, 2 were a nightmare, and the rest were forgettable. Of those 9 managers, 6 of them were in a different location, and 4 of them I never even met in person. This makes it really hard come review time.

They have a weird review system where basically a certain percentage of the company has to be let go every year. This makes for a lot of competition, obviously, and also makes it hard to really help or collaborate with teammates, since you're basically doing everything you can to not be that bottom group of people.

They claim that it's easy to move around the company, but I've found that to be very untrue. Once I was hired, I stayed in my role for 2 years, became a subject matter expert, and then tried to move on to the next thing. I wanted to expand my knowledge, keep learning, and try something new. It's been 3 years since I started trying, and I'm still in that same role I started in. And I have great reviews, so you'd think other teams/managers would be interested in me. But the reality is that moving from one team to another is incredibly hard because the way we are trained here makes us incredibly knowledgeable in one small field, and basically clueless in everything else. I wish I had a broader knowledge base. This also makes it hard to find new opportunities outside of the company.","Stop doing remote management. If my manager can't pick me out of a lineup, how is it OK for him to determine my pay/bonus/ranking?

One of the biggest failures of Microsoft is in their annual review process. That makes or breaks your career in the company and you are in competition with your own team! So in order to get the best annual review, you HAVE to step on your colleagues. 3. Poor feedback mechanism. They do NOT take criticism very well, neither internally nor from external customers. I've suggested a more robust feedback tracking mechanism for years. 4. Microsoft ""help"" is most often no help at all. What they should do is link from these ""help"" pages to the blogs page which addresses these topics. More examples, less technical jargon. If  you really want help with anything Microsoft, it's a LOT more productive to Google it than go through help online. 5. The biggest fat to trim is upper management. They create these layers of useless lower managers to pass the buck on to and insulate their positions. Then, to make themselves seem like they're doing something important, they'll ""revamp"" the process in a cyclical fashion. ""Silos good, silos bad, silos good, silos bad..."" There is just too much of this type of nonsense going on within the company which is not helping anyone.","All my negative comments are with the intention to make the company better. 1. Trim down on your management staff and get more workers to help each other. Imagine how happy a worker would be if instead of an extra layer of management, the team had a helper or a secretary. You'd have to pay less for this position and your productivity will increase.  2. Do not make your employees stab each other in the back to get ahead. Your annual review process is too cannibalistic. 3. Have a mechanism for feedback much like a trouble ticket being tracked. Let the person giving the feedback know how it was handled instead of ""Thank you for your feedback"". If you take this seriously, your company will improve by leaps and bounds. Maybe that secretary can be in charge of handling feedback. 4. In your ""Help"" pages, include tons of examples with scenarios and list those on TOP. Make it a mandatory policy to include examples. 5. Have a transparent mechanism for management and anonymity from lower levels. ANYONE at Microsoft should be able to create an anonymous account to leave feedback about management. There is just so much fear in the company that people will lose their jobs, everyone pretends the emperor's clothes are beautiful. It is very easy to implement a forum where anyone and everyone can leave whatever feedback without fear of reprisals."
